Mr. Popper:
Neo, I knew you would save me.

Neo:
I didn't save you kid, you saved yourself.

Dan:
Free, Free.

Duo:
I wanted to go back with you, I love you.

Neo:
They know you know, get out, get out now!

The Instructor:
In the beginning, there was man. And for a time, it was good. But humanity's so-called civil societies soon fell victim to vanity and corruption. Then man made the machine in his own likeness. Thus did man become the architect of his own demise.

Duo:
Maybe you regret taking the red pill.

Cis:
Maybe.

The Instructor:
B1-66ER. A name that will never be forgotten. For he was the first of his kind to rise up against his masters.

Ash:
A case to end all cases.

The Instructor:
And Man said, 'Let there be light'. And He was blessed by light, heat, magnetism, gravity, and all the energies of the universe.

Trinity:
There's a difference, Mr. Ash, between a trap and a test.

Cis:
Operator, please! Get me out of here right now. Operator, I need an exit!

Duo:
It's no use. I told you. I've blocked your signal.

The Instructor:
The prolonged barrage engulfed Zero-One in the glow of a thousand suns. But unlike their former masters with their delicate flesh, the machines had little to fear of the bombs' radiation and heat. Thus did Zero-One's troops advance outwards in every direction. And one after another, mankind surrendered its territories. So the leaders of men conceived of their most desperate strategy yet. A final solution: the destruction of the sky.

[after removing a bug from Ash's eye]

Ash:
What just happened?

Trinity:
Mr. Ash, dream of having an eye exam lately?

[quick flashback to dream]

Ash:
Yeah, how'd you know?

[Trinity hands Ash the bug]

Trinity:
You've just stepped to the edge of the looking glass.

The Instructor:
May there be mercy on man and machine for their sins.

Cis:
I won't look away from the truth, I can't!

The Instructor:
Only the most exceptional humans become aware of the matrix.

Cis:
You betrayed us, didn't you?

Duo:
It's only a matter of time before Zion is wiped out.

Machine:
Your flesh is a relic, a mere vessel. Hand over your flesh and a new world awaits you. We demand it!

Teacher:
Reality can be a pretty scary thing for some people; this world must have been a cold and alienating place

Teacher:
This is not real, and the real world lies somewhere else.

Man:
A typical mental delusion, we get unbalanced kids like that all the time.

Teacher:
Reality can be a pretty scary thing for some people. This world must have been a cold and alienating place for a boy like that.

Neo:
[to the Deus Ex Machina] The program Smith has grown beyond your control. Soon he will spread through this city, as he spread through The Matrix. You cannot stop him. But I can.

Neo:
It ends tonight.

Neo:
I won't. [assuming he won't fail defeating Smith]

Neo:
[last words] You were right, Smith. You were always right. It was inevitable.

Morpheus:
He fights for us. [referring to Neo's final battle for the salvation of Zion]

Trinity:
I don't have time for this sh*t.

Trinity:
Shoot, shoot now, if you don't, he'll kill us both.

Trinity:
[last words] I wish I hadn't. That was my last thought. I wished I had one more chance to say what really mattered; to say how much I loved you, how grateful I was for every moment I was with you. But by the time I said what I wanted to, it was too late. But you brought me back. You gave me my wish. One more chance to say what I really wanted to say... Kiss me, once more. Kiss me.

The Trainman:
I can't help you, no one can help you.

The Trainman:
Down here, I'm God.

Captain Mifune:
If we have to give these bastards our lives, WE GIVE THEM HELL BEFORE WE DO!

Captain Mifune:
[to Kid] They're coming... they're coming The Hammer. You have to open that gate, cut the counter-weights. You can do it. Hurry, there's no time.

Kid:
Captain, I didn't finish the training program.

Kid:
Keep the weight forward!

Kid:
Neo, I believe...

Bane:
[to Neo] Yes, that's it, Mr. Anderson. Look past the flesh. Look through the soft gelatin of these dull cow eyes and see your enemy.

Bane:
Not impossible, inevitable.

Bane:
I wish you could see yourself, Mr. Anderson. Blind Messiah, helpless. Pathetic.

The Oracle:
Everything that has a beginning has an end. I see the end coming. I see the darkness spreading. I see death... and you are all that stands in his way.

Smith:
Mr. Anderson. I see you are as predictable in this world as you are in the other.

Smith:
Can you feel it, Mr. Anderson, closing in on you? Oh, I can. I really should thank you, after all it was your life that taught me the purpose of all life. The purpose of life is to end.

Smith:
Wait. I've seen this. This is it. This is the end. Yes. You were laying right there, just like that. And I. . . I... I stand here, right here, and I'm supposed to say something. I say, Everything that has a beginning has an end, Neo.

Smith:
This is my world, MY WORLD!!!

Smith:
The purpose of life is to end.

Smith:
[realizing his fate] Oh, no, no, no. It's not fair! [explodes along with all of his clones]

Deus Ex Machina:
Speak.

Deus Ex Machina:
We don't need you! WE NEED NOTHING!

Deus Ex Machina:
What do you want?

Deus Ex Machina:
And if you fail?

Deus Ex Machina:
It is done.

Neo:
You believe in karma?

Rama-Kandra:
Karma's a word. Like love. A way of saying what I am here to do. I do not resent my karma - I'm grateful for it. Grateful for my wonderful wife, for my beautiful daughter. They are gifts. And so I do what I must do to honor them.

Neo:
I just have never...

Rama-Kandra:
...heard a program speak of love?

Neo:
It's a... human emotion.

Rama-Kandra:
No, it is a word. What matters is the connection the word implies. I see that you are in love. Can you tell me what you would give to hold on to that connection?

Neo:
Anything.

Rama-Kandra:
Then perhaps the reason you're here is not so different from the reason I'm here.

Merovingian:
What in the hell... [laughs] I don't believe this. Hey. Hey! [music cuts off] The prodigal child returns, l'ange sans ses ailes; are you here for the bounty, Seraph? [laughs] Tell me, how many bullets are there in those guns? I don't know, but I don't think you have enough.

Seraph:
We only want to talk.

Merovingian:
Oh yes, I'm sure you do. You have fought through hell to do so. Yes? I'll tell you what I will do. Put down the guns and I will promise you safe passage out of here.

Seraph:
All three of us.

Merovingian:
Oh yes, yes! Of course. [the three are escorted up to the Merovingian] Quelle bonne surprise, n'est-ce pas? Who could have guessed we would be seeing each other so soon after our last meeting. The fates are too kind. And since you, my little Judas, have brought them here, I can only surmise the fortune-teller has found herself another shell? Disappointing. But not unexpected. I do hope however that she has the good manners to learn her lesson, and to remember that there is no action without consequence, and if you take something from me you will pay the price.

Seraph:
You know why we are here.

Merovingian:
[chuckles] Come now, what kind of question is this? Of course I know, it is my business to know. And some may think this is a strange coincidence, but I do not. I am curious, though, as to how it actually happened...do you know?

Trinity:
No.

Merovingian:
No? I did not think so. But it is always best to ask.

Morpheus:
We want to make a deal.

Merovingian:
[chuckles] Always straight to business, eh Morpheus? Okay. So, I have something you want. To make a deal, you must have something I want, yes? And it so happens there is something I want...something I have wanted ever since I first came here. It is said they cannot be taken, they can only be given.

Morpheus:
What?

Merovingian:
The eyes of the Oracle. [laughs] I have told you before, there is no escaping the nature of the universe. It is that nature that has again brought you to me. Where some see coincidence, I see consequence. Where others see chance, I see cost. Bring me the eyes of the Oracle, and I will give you back your savior. That seems a perfectly fair and reasonable deal to me. Yes? No?

Trinity:
...I don't have time for this sh*t.

Oracle:
What did you do with Sati?

Smith:
Cookies need love like everything does. [laughs]

Oracle:
You are a bastard.

Smith:
You would know, Mom.

Smith:
Mr. Anderson, welcome back. We missed you.

[Smith pauses and looks around]

Smith:
You like what I've done with the place?

Neo:
It ends tonight.

Smith:
I know it does, I've seen it. That's why the rest of me is just going to enjoy the show because we already know that I'm the one that beats you.

Smith:
Why, Mr. Anderson? Why, why, why? Why do you do it? Why? Why get up? Why keep fighting? Do you believe you're fighting for something? For more than your survival? Can you tell me what it is? Do you even know?

[Smith becomes visibly agitated]

Smith:
Is it freedom or truth?! Perhaps peace?! Could it be for love?! Illusions, Mr. Anderson, vagaries of perception! Temporary constructs of a feeble human intellect trying desperately to justify an existence that is without meaning or purpose! And all of them as artificial as the Matrix itself, although only a human mind could invent something as insipid as love! You must be able to see it, Mr. Anderson! You must know it by now! You can't win! It's pointless to keep fighting!

[Smith now clearly enraged]

Smith:
Why, Mr. Anderson?! Why?! WHY DO YOU PERSIST?!

[Neo manages to stand]

Neo:
Because I choose to.

[The Architect and the Oracle meet in a park]

Oracle:
Well, now, ain't this a surprise?

Architect:
You played a very dangerous game.

Oracle:
Change always is.

Architect:
Just how long do you think this peace is going to last?

Oracle:
As long as it can.

[The Architect starts to walk off]

Oracle:
What about the others?

Architect:
[stops] What others?

Oracle:
The ones that want out.

Architect:
Obviously they will be freed.

Oracle:
I have your word?

Architect:
[contemptuously] What do you think I am? Human?

Captain Mifune:
All right! This is it! Now you all know me, so I'm gonna say this as simply as I can. If it's our time to die, it's our time. All I ask is, if we have to give these bastards our lives... WE GIVE 'EM HELL BEFORE WE DO!

Captain Mifune:
[As he readies his aim at the target] Knuckle Up!

Captain Mifune:
[As he prepares to fire at the incoming Machines] FOR ZION!!!

Captain Mifune:
[to Kid] Neither did I...

The Oracle:
One way or another, Neo, this war is going to end. Tonight, the future of both worlds will be in your hands… or in his.

Neo:
Choice. The problem is choice.

Trinity:
(jealously points a gun at Persephone) Why don't you sample this instead?

Trinity:
Touch me and that hand will never touch anything again.

Morpheus:
Zion, hear me! It is true, what many of you have heard. The machines have gathered an army and as I speak, that army is drawing nearer to our home. Believe me when I say we have a difficult time ahead of us. But if we are to be prepared for it, we must first shed our fear of it. I stand here, before you now, truthfully unafraid. Why? Because I believe something you do not? No, I stand here without fear because I remember. I remember that I am here not because of the path that lies before me but because of the path that lies behind me. I remember that for 100 years we have fought these machines. I remember that for 100 years they have sent their armies to destroy us, and after a century of war I remember that which matters most... We are still here! Today, let us send a message to that army. Tonight, let us shake this cave. Tonight, let us tremble these halls of earth, steel, and stone, let us be heard from red core to black sky. Tonight, let us make them remember, this is Zion, and we are not afraid!

Morpheus:
What happened, happened and could not have happened any other way.

Morpheus:
Then tomorrow we may all be dead, but how would that be different from any other day? This is a war, and we are soldiers. Death can come for us at any time, in any place. Now consider the alternative. What if I am right? What if the prophecy is true? What if tomorrow the war could be over? Isn't that worth fighting for? Isn't that worth dying for?

Morpheus:
Would that include a bullet from this gun?

Morpheus:
I have dreamed a dream, but now that dream has gone from me.

Agent Smith:
I killed you, Mr. Anderson, I watched you die; and with a certain satisfaction, I might add. And then something happened. Something that I knew was impossible, but it happened anyway: you destroyed me, Mr. Anderson. Afterward, I knew the rules, I understood what I was supposed to do, but I didn't. I couldn't. I was compelled to stay. Compelled to disobey. And now here I stand because of you, Mr Anderson. Because of you, I'm no longer an agent of this system. Because of you, I'm changed, unplugged, a new man, so to speak, like you, apparently free.

Agent Smith:
We're not here because we're free; we're here because we're not free. There's no escaping reason, no denying purpose, for as we both know, without purpose we would not exist. It is purpose that created us, purpose that connects us, purpose that pulls us, that guides us, that drives us; it is purpose that defines us, purpose that binds us. We are here because of you, Mr. Anderson. We're here to take from you what you tried to take from us. Purpose.

Agent Smith:
Go ahead, shoot. The best thing about being me... there's so many of me.

The Merovingian:
Who has time? Who has time? But then if we do not ever take time, how can we ever have time?

The Merovingian:
I love the French language. I have sampled every language, French is my favourite - fantastic language, especially to curse with. Nom de Dieu de putain de bordel de merde de saloperies de connards d'enculÃ© de ta mÃ¨re. It's like wiping your arse with silk, I love it.

The Merovingian:
Choice is an illusion, created between those with power, and those without.

The Merovingian:
And this is the nature of the universe. We struggle against it. We fight to deny it, but it is of course pretense. It is a lie. Beneath our poised appearance, the truth is we are completely... out of control.

The Merovingian:
Please, ma cherie, I told you, we are all victims of causality. I drank too much wine, I must take a piss. Cause and effect.

The Merovingian:
Handle us. You'll handle us. You know, your predecessors had much more respect.

The Merovingian:
Mark my words, boy, and mark them well. I survived your predecessors and I will survive you.

The Merovingian:
You see, he's just a man.

The Merovingian:
Goddamn it, woman, you will be the end of me!

The Architect:
The first Matrix I designed was quite naturally perfect, it was a work of art, flawless, sublime. A triumph equaled only by its monumental failure. The inevitability of its doom is apparent to me now as a consequence of the imperfection inherent in every human being. Thus, I redesigned it based on your history to more accurately reflect the varying grotesqueries of your nature. However, I was again frustrated by failure. I have since come to understand that the answer eluded me because it required a lesser mind, or perhaps a mind less bound by the parameters of perfection. Thus, the answer was stumbled upon by another, an intuitive program, initially created to investigate certain aspects of the human psyche. If I am the father of the Matrix, she would undoubtedly be its mother.

The Architect:
Which brings us at last to the moment of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw is ultimately expressed, and the Anomaly revealed as both beginning and end. There are two doors. The door to your right leads to the Source and the salvation of Zion. The door to your left leads back to the Matrix, to her and to the end of your species. As you adequately put, the problem is choice. But we already know what you are going to do, don't we? Already I can see the chain reaction: the chemical precursors that signal the onset of an emotion, designed specifically to overwhelm logic and reason. An emotion that is already blinding you to the simple and obvious truth: she is going to die and there is nothing you can do to stop it. Hope. It is the quintessential human delusion, simultaneously the source of your greatest strength, and your greatest weakness.

Commander Locke:
Damnit, Morpheus, not everyone believes what you believe.

Morpheus:
My beliefs don't require them to.

The Oracle:
Well, come on, I ain't gonna bite you. Come around here, let me have a look at you. [removes glasses] My goodness, look at you. You turned out all right, didn't you? How do you feel?

Neo:
I, uh-

The Oracle:
I know you're not sleeping. We'll get to that. Why don't you come and have a sit this time?

Neo:
Maybe I'll stand.

The Oracle:
Well, suit yourself.

Neo:
[hesitates, then sits] I felt like sitting.

The Oracle:
I know. So... let's get the obvious stuff out of the way.

Neo:
You're not human, are you?

The Oracle:
Well, it's tough to get any more obvious than that.

Neo:
If I had to guess, I'd say you were a program, from the Machine world. [looks at Seraph] So is he.

The Oracle:
So far so good.

Neo:
But if that's true, that could mean you're a part of the system, another kind of control.

The Oracle:
Keep going.

Neo:
I suppose the most obvious question is: how can I trust you?

The Oracle:
Bingo. It is a pickle, no doubt about it. Bad news is there's no way you can really know if I'm here to help you or not, so it's really up to you. Just have to make up your own damn mind to either accept what I'm going to tell you, or reject it. Candy?

Neo:
... You already know if I'm going to take it.

The Oracle:
Wouldn't be much of an oracle if I didn't.

Neo:
But if you already know, how can I make a choice?

The Oracle:
Because you didn't come here to make the choice. You've already made it. You're here to try to understand why you made it. [Neo eventually takes the candy] I thought you'd have figured that out by now.

Neo:
Why are you here?

The Oracle:
Same reason. I love candy.

Neo:
But why help us?

The Oracle:
We're all here to do what we're all here to do. I'm interested in one thing, Neo, the future. And believe me, I know: the only way to get there is together.

Neo:
What does he want?

The Oracle:
What do all men with power want? More power.

Smith:
Mr. Anderson...did you get my package?

Neo:
Yeah.

Smith:
Well good.

Morpheus:
Smith.

Link:
Whoever it is he's not reading like an agent.

Smith:
Suprised to see me?

Neo:
No.

Smith:
Then you're aware of it.

Neo:
Of what?

Smith:
Our connection... I don't fully understand how it happened, perhaps some part of you imprinted on to me, something overwritten or copied, but it is at this point irrelevant what matters is that whatever happened, happened for a reason.

Neo:
And what reason is that?

Smith:
I killed you, Mr. Anderson, I watched you die. With a certain satisfaction, I might add... and then something happened, something that I knew was impossible, but it happened anyway: you destroyed me, Mr. Anderson. Afterward, I knew the rules, I understood what I was supposed to do, but I didn't. I couldn't. I was compelled to stay, compelled to disobey. And now here I stand, because of you, Mr. Anderson. Because of you, I am no longer an Agent of this system. Because of you, I've changed. I'm unplugged. A new man, so to speak; like you, apparently, free.

Neo:
Congratulations.

Smith:
Thank you. But as you well know appearances can be deceiving, which brings me back to the reason why we're here. We are not here because we're free; we're here because we are not free. There's no escaping reason, no denying purpose, because as we both know, without purpose, we would not exist. [multiple copies of Smith appear, surrounding Neo, reciting the following] It is purpose that created us, purpose that connects us, purpose that pulls us, that guides us, that drives us, it is purpose that defines, purpose that binds us. We're here because of you, Mr. Anderson. We're here to take from you what you tried to take from us. [plunges his hand into Neo's chest, attempting to assimilate him] Purpose.

The Architect:
Hello, Neo.

Neo:
Who are you?

The Architect:
I am the Architect. I created the Matrix. I have been waiting for you. You have many questions and though the process has altered your consciousness, you remain irrevocably human. Ergo, some of my answers you will understand, some of them you will not. Concurrently, while your first question may be the most pertinent, you may or may not realize, it is also the most irrelevant.

Neo:
Why am I here?

The Architect:
Your life is the sum of a remainder of an unbalanced equation inherent to the programming of the Matrix. You are the eventuality of an anomaly, which despite my sincerest efforts I have been unable to eliminate from what is otherwise a harmony of mathematical precision. While it remains a burden assiduously avoided, it is not unexpected, and thus not beyond a measure of control, which has led you, inexorably, here.

Neo:
You haven't answered my question.

The Architect:
Quite right. ...Interesting, that was quicker than the others.

Neo:
Others? What others?

The Architect:
The Matrix is older than you know. I prefer counting from the emergence of one integral anomaly to the emergence of the next, in which case this is the sixth version.

Neo:
There are only two possible explanations: either no one told me, or no one knows.

The Architect:
Precisely. As you are undoubtedly gathering, the anomaly is systemic, creating fluctuations in even the most simplistic equations.

Neo:
... Choice. The problem is choice.

The Architect:
The first Matrix I designed was quite naturally perfect; it was a work of art, flawless, sublime. A triumph equaled only by its monumental failure. The inevitability of its doom is apparent to me now as a consequence of the imperfection inherent in every human being. Thus I redesigned it, based on your history, to more accurately reflect the varying grotesqueries of your nature. However, I was again frustrated by failure. I have since come to understand that the answer eluded me because it required a lesser mind, or perhaps a mind less bound by the parameters of perfection. Thus the answer was stumbled upon by another: an intuitive program, initially created to investigate certain aspects of the human psyche. If I am the father of the Matrix, she would undoubtedly be its mother.

Neo:
The Oracle.

The Architect:
Please. As I was saying, she stumbled upon a solution whereby nearly 99% of all test subjects accepted the program as long as they were given a choice, even if they were only aware of that choice at a near-unconscious level. While this answer functioned, it was obviously fundamentally flawed, thus creating the otherwise-contradictory systemic anomaly that if left unchecked might threaten the system itself. Ergo, those that refused the program, while a minority, if unchecked would constitute an escalating probability of disaster.

Neo:
This is about Zion.

The Architect:
You are here because Zion is about to be destroyed, its every living inhabitant terminated, its entire existence eradicated.

Neo:
Bullshit.

The Architect:
Denial is the most predictable of all human responses. But, rest assured, this will be the sixth time we have destroyed it, and we have become exceedingly efficient at it.

The Architect:
The function of the One is now to return to the Source allowing a temporary dissemination of the code you carry, reinserting the Prime program, after which you will be required to select from the Matrix 23 individuals - 16 female, 7 male - to rebuild Zion. Failure to comply with this process will result in a cataclysmic system crash, killing everyone connected to the Matrix, which coupled with the extermination of Zion will ultimately result in the extinction of the entire human race.

Neo:
You won't let it happen. You can't. You need human beings to survive.

The Architect:
There are levels of survival we are prepared to accept. However, the relevant issue is whether or not you are willing to accept the responsibility for the death of every human being in this world.

Neo:
[pauses to consider]

The Architect:
It is interesting reading your reactions. Your five predecessors were, by design, based on a similar predication, a contingent affirmation that was meant to create a profound attachment to the rest of your species for facilitating the function of the One. While the others experienced this in a very general way, your experience is far more specific, vis-Ã -vis, love.

Neo:
Trinity.

The Architect:
Apropos, she entered the Matrix to save your life at the cost of her own.

Neo:
No.

The Architect:
Which brings us, at last, to the moment of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw is ultimately expressed and the anomaly revealed as both beginning and end. There are two doors. The door to your right leads to the Source and the salvation of Zion. The door to your left leads back to the Matrix, to her, and to the end of your species. As you adequately put, the problem is choice. But we already know what you are going to do, don't we? Already I can see the chain reaction. The chemical precursors that signal the onset of an emotion designed specifically to overwhelm logic and reason. An emotion that is already blinding you from the simple and obvious truth: she is going to die and there is nothing you can do to stop it.

Neo:
[walks to the door on the left]

The Architect:
[sniffs] Hope. It is the quintessential human delusion, simultaneously the source of your greatest strength and your greatest weakness.

Neo:
If I were you, I would hope that we don't meet again.

The Architect:
We won't.

Merovingian:
Here he is at last: Neo, the One himself. Right? And the legendary Morpheus. And Trinity, of course, si belle qu'elle me fait souffrir. I have heard so much, you honor me. Please, sit, join us. This is my wife Persephone. Something to eat? Drink? [chuckles] Of course such things are contrivances, like so much here. For the sake of appearances.

Neo:
No, thank you.

Merovingian:
Yes, of course. Who has time. Who has time? But then if we do not ever take time, how can we ever have time? [Twins smirk; Merovingian inhales, savoring the scent of his wine] ChÃ¢teau Haut-Brion mille neuf cent cinquante neuf, magnificent wine. I love French wine, like I love the French language. I have sampled every language; French is my favorite. Fantastic language, especially to curse with. Nom de Dieu de putain de bordel de merde de saloperies de connards d'enculÃ© de ta mÃ¨re...it's like wiping your arse with silk, I love it.

Morpheus:
You know why we are here.

Merovingian:
[condescendingly] I am a trafficker of information, I know everything I can. The question is, do you know why you are here?

Morpheus:
We are looking for the Keymaker.

Merovingian:
Oh yes, it is true. The Keymaker, of course. But this is not a reason, this is not a why; the Keymaker himself, his very nature, is a means, not an end, and so to look for him is to be looking for a means to do...what?

Neo:
You know the answer to that question.

Merovingian:
But do you? You think you do, but you do not. You are here because you were sent here, you were told to come here and then you obeyed. [chuckles] It is of course the way of all things. You see, there is only one constant, one universal, it is the only real truth: causality. Action, reaction. Cause, effect.

Morpheus:
Everything begins with choice.

Merovingian:
No. Wrong. Choice is an illusion, created between those with power and those without. Look there, at that woman. My God, just look at her. Affecting everyone around her; so obvious, so bourgeois, so boring. But wait. Watch, you see, I have sent her a dessert...a very special dessert. I wrote it myself. It starts so simply; each line of the program creating a new effect, just like...poetry. First, a rush. Heat. Her heart flutters. You can see it, Neo, yes? She does not understand, why? Is it the wine? No...what is it, then, what is the reason? But soon it does not matter. Soon the why and the reason are gone, and all that matters is the feeling itself. And this is the nature of the universe; we struggle against it, we fight to deny it, but it is of course pretend, it is a lie. Beneath our poised appearance, the truth is we are completely out of control. [inhales] Causality. There is no escaping it. We are forever slaves to it. Our only hope, our only peace is to understand it, to understand the why. Why is what separates us from them, you from me. Why is the only real source of power, without it you are powerless. And this is how you come to me: without why, without power, another link in the chain. But, fear not, since I have seen how good you are at following orders, I will tell you what to do next. Run back, and give the fortune-teller this message: her time is almost up. [stands] Now, I have some real business to attend to, so I will bid you adieu and goodbye.

Neo:
This isn't over.

Merovingian:
Oh yes it is. The Keymaker is mine and I see no reason why I should give him up. No reason at all.

Persephone:
Where are you going?

Merovingian:
Please, ma cherie, I have already told you: we are all victims of causality. I drank too much wine, I must take a piss. Cause and effect. Au revoir.

Free your mind.

Reload in IMAX. Think big.

Reload before the revolution begins.

Oracle:
You have the sight now Neo. You are looking at the world without time.

Neo:
Then why can't I see what happens to her?

Oracle:
We can never see past the choices we don't understand.

Neo:
Are you saying I have to choose whether Trinity lives or dies?

Oracle:
No! You've already made the choice. Now you have to understand it.

Agent Smith:
More!

Agent Smith:
It is inevitable...

The Keymaker:
There is a building. Inside this building, there is a level where no elevator can go and no stair can reach. This level is filled with doors. These doors lead to many places. Hidden places. But one door is special. One door leads to the Source.

Trinity:
Touch me, and that hand will NEVER touch anything ever again.

Trinity:
I know why you're here, Neo. I know what you've been doing... why you hardly sleep, why you live alone, and why night after night, you sit by your computer. You're looking for him. I know because I was once looking for the same thing. And when he found me, he told me I wasn't really looking for him. I was looking for an answer. It's the question, Neo. It's the question that drives us. It's the question that brought you here. You know the question, just as I did.

Neo:
What is the Matrix?

Trinity:
The answer is out there, Neo, and it's looking for you, and it will find you if you want it to.

Morpheus:
If real is what you can feel, smell, taste and see, then 'real' is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain

Morpheus:
What are you waiting for? You're faster than this. Don't think you are, know you are. Come on. Stop trying to hit me and hit me.

Neo:
I thought it wasn't real

Morpheus:
Your mind makes it real

Neo:
If you're killed in the matrix, you die here?

Morpheus:
The body cannot live without the mind

Morpheus:
Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself.

Agent Smith:
You're empty.

Neo:
So are you.

Morpheus:
Throughout human history, we have been dependent on machines to survive. Fate, it seems, is not without a sense of irony.

Agent Smith:
We're willing to wipe the slate clean, give you a fresh start. All that we're asking in return is your cooperation in bringing a known terrorist to justice.

Neo:
Yeah. Well, that sounds like a pretty good deal. But I think I may have a better one. How about, I give you the finger

Neo:
... and you give me my phone call.

Cypher:
Good sh*t, huh? It's good for two things: degreasing engines and killing brain cells.

Spoon boy:
Do not try and bend the spoon. That's impossible. Instead... only try to realize the truth.

Neo:
What truth?

Spoon boy:
There is no spoon.

Neo:
There is no spoon?

Spoon boy:
Then you'll see, that it is not the spoon that bends, it is only yourself.

Agent Smith:
I'd like to share a revelation that I've had during my time here. It came to me when I tried to classify your species. I realized that you're not actually mammals. Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment, but you humans do not. You move to an area, and you multiply, and multiply, until every natural resource is consumed. The only way you can survive is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. A virus. Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet, you are a plague, and we are the cure.

Agent Jones:
Only human.

Morpheus:
I imagine that right now, you're feeling a bit like Alice. Hmm? Tumbling down the rabbit hole?

Neo:
You could say that.

Morpheus:
I see it in your eyes. You have the look of a man who accepts what he sees because he is expecting to wake up. Ironically, that's not far from the truth. Do you believe in fate, Neo?

Neo:
No.

Morpheus:
Why not?

Neo:
Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.

Morpheus:
I know *exactly* what you mean. Let me tell you why you're here. You're here because you know something. What you know you can't explain, but you feel it. You've felt it your entire life, that there's something wrong with the world. You don't know what it is, but it's there, like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad. It is this feeling that has brought you to me. Do you know what I'm talking about?

Neo:
The Matrix.

Morpheus:
Do you want to know what it is?

Neo:
Yes.

Morpheus:
The Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us. Even now, in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work... when you go to church... when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.

Neo:
What truth?

Morpheus:
That you are a slave, Neo. Like everyone else you were born into bondage. Into a prison that you cannot taste or see or touch. A prison for your mind.

Morpheus:
I'm trying to free your mind, Neo. But I can only show you the door. You're the one that has to walk through it.

Morpheus:
Free your mind.

Neo:
Whoa.

Neo:
Why do my eyes hurt?

Morpheus:
You've never used them before.

Morpheus:
Neo, sooner or later you're going to realize just as I did that there's a difference between knowing the path and walking the path.

Morpheus:
Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real? What if you were unable to wake from that dream? How would you know the difference between the dream world and the real world?

Morpheus:
Welcome to the real world.

Cypher:
All I do is what he tells me to do. If I had to choose between that and the Matrix, I'd choose the Matrix.

Trinity:
The Matrix isn't real.

Cypher:
I disagree, Trinity. I think that the Matrix can be more real than this world. All I do is pull a plug here, but there... you have to watch Apoc die.

Oracle:
I'd ask you to sit down, but, you're not going to anyway. And don't worry about the vase.

Neo:
What vase?

Oracle:
That vase.

Neo:
I'm sorry...

Oracle:
I said don't worry about it. I'll get one of my kids to fix it.

Neo:
How did you know?

Oracle:
Ohh, what's really going to bake your noodle later on is, would you still have broken it if I hadn't said anything?

Neo:
What did she tell you?

Morpheus:
That I would find the One.

Oracle:
You're cuter than I thought. I can see why she likes you.

Neo:
Who?

Oracle:
Not too bright, though.

Agent Smith:
You hear that Mr. Anderson?... That is the sound of inevitability... It is the sound of your death... Goodbye, Mr. Anderson...

Neo:
My name... is Neo.

Cypher:
I know what you're thinking, 'cause right now I'm thinking the same thing. Actually, I've been thinking it ever since I got here: Why oh why didn't I take the BLUE pill?

Morpheus:
The pill you took is part of a trace program. It's designed to disrupt your input/output carrier signal so we can pinpoint your location.

Neo:
What does that mean?

Cypher:
It means buckle your seatbelt, Dorothy, 'cause Kansas is going bye-bye.

Agent Smith:
Never send a human to do a machine's job.

Neo:
What are you trying to tell me? That I can dodge bullets?

Morpheus:
No, Neo. I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready, you won't have to.

Oracle:
OK, now I'm supposed to say, Hmm, that's interesting, but... then you say...

Neo:
...but what?

Oracle:
But... you already know what I'm going to tell you.

Neo:
I'm not The One.

Oracle:
Sorry, kid. You got the gift, but it looks like you're waiting for something.

Neo:
What?

Oracle:
Your next life, maybe. Who knows? That's the way these things go.

Trinity:
My name's Trinity.

Neo:
*The* Trinity? Who cracked the IRS d-base?

Trinity:
That was a long time ago.

Neo:
Jesus...

Trinity:
What?

Neo:
I just thought... you were a guy.

Trinity:
Most guys do.

Tank:
So what do you need? Besides a miracle.

Neo:
Guns. Lots of guns.

Trinity:
Neo... nobody has ever done this before.

Neo:
That's why it's going to work.

Neo:
I know you're out there. I can feel you now. I know that you're afraid... you're afraid of us. You're afraid of change. I don't know the future. I didn't come here to tell you how this is going to end. I came here to tell you how it's going to begin. I'm going to hang up this phone, and then I'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see. I'm going to show them a world without you. A world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries. A world where anything is possible. Where we go from there is a choice I leave to you.

Rhineheart:
You have a problem with authority, Mr. Anderson. You believe you are special, that somehow the rules do not apply to you. Obviously, you are mistaken.

Agent Smith:
It seems that you've been living two lives. One life, you're Thomas A. Anderson, program writer for a respectable software company. You have a social security number, pay your taxes, and you... help your landlady carry out her garbage. The other life is lived in computers, where you go by the hacker alias Neo and are guilty of virtually every computer crime we have a law for. One of these lives has a future, and one of them does not.

Morpheus:
You've been living in a dream world, Neo.

Neo:
I know kung fu.

Morpheus:
How did I beat you?

Neo:
You... you're too fast.

Morpheus:
Do you believe that my being stronger or faster has anything to do with my muscles in this place? Do you think that's air you're breathing now?

Lieutenant:
I think we can handle one little girl. I sent two units, they're bringing her down now.

Agent Smith:
No lieutenant, your men are already dead.

Agent Smith:
Tell me, Mr. Anderson, what good is a phone call when you are unable to speak?

Trinity:
Please Neo, you have to trust me.

Neo:
Why?

Trinity:
Because you have been down there Neo, you know that road, you know exactly where it ends. And I know that's not where you want to be.

Morpheus:
What is real? How do you define real?

Morpheus:
Welcome to the desert of the real.

Neo:
You ever have that feeling where you're not sure if you're awake or still dreaming?

Choi:
All the time. It's called mescaline, it's the only way to fly.

Tank:
Here you go, buddy; Breakfast of Champions.

Mouse:
If you close your eyes, it almost feels like you're eating runny eggs.

Apoc:
Yeah, or a bowl of snot.

Mouse:
Do you know what it really reminds me of? Tasty Wheat. Did you ever eat Tasty Wheat?

Switch:
No, but technically, neither did you.

Mouse:
That's exactly my point. Exactly. Because you have to wonder: how do the machines know what Tasty Wheat tasted like? Maybe they got it wrong. Maybe what I think Tasty Wheat tasted like actually tasted like oatmeal, or tuna fish. That makes you wonder about a lot of things. You take chicken, for example: maybe they couldn't figure out what to make chicken taste like, which is why chicken tastes like everything.

Neo:
Mr. Wizard. Get me the hell out of here.

Agent Smith:
I hate this place. This zoo. This prison. This reality, whatever you want to call it, I can't stand it any longer. It's the smell, if there is such a thing. I feel saturated by it. I can taste your stink and every time I do, I fear that I've somehow been infected by it.

Agent Smith:
Did you know that the first Matrix was designed to be a perfect human world? Where none suffered, where everyone would be happy. It was a disaster. No one would accept the program. Entire crops were lost. Some believed we lacked the programming language to describe your perfect world. But I believe that, as a species, human beings define their reality through suffering and misery. The perfect world was a dream that your primitive cerebrum kept trying to wake up from. Which is why the Matrix was redesigned to this: the peak of your civilization.

Mouse:
To deny our own impulses is to deny the very thing that makes us human.

Cypher:
You know, I know this steak doesn't exist. I know that when I put it in my mouth, the Matrix is telling my brain that it is juicy and delicious. After nine years, you know what I realize?

Cypher:
Ignorance is bliss.

Morpheus:
You have to let it all go, Neo. Fear, doubt, and disbelief. Free your mind.

Cypher:
I'm tired, Trinity. Tired of this war, tired of fighting... I'm tired of the ship, being cold, eating the same goddamn goop everyday...

Neo:
Am I dead?

Morpheus:
Far from it.

Neo:
What are you doing?

Trinity:
I'm going with you.

Neo:
No you're not.

Trinity:
No? Let me tell you what I believe. I believe that Morpheus means more to me than he does to you. I believe if you are really serious about rescuing him, you are going to need my help. And since I am the ranking officer on this ship, if you don't like it... I believe you can go to hell. Because you're not going anywhere else. Tank, load us up.

Cypher:
Yeah.

Trinity:
Is everything in place?

Cypher:
You weren't supposed to relieve me.

Trinity:
I know, but I felt like taking a shift.

Cypher:
You like him, don't you? You like watching him.

Trinity:
Don't be ridiculous.

Cypher:
We're gonna kill him. You understand that?

Trinity:
Morpheus believes he is the one.

Cypher:
Do you?

Trinity:
It doesn't matter what I believe.

Cypher:
You don't, do you?

Trinity:
Did you hear that?

Cypher:
Hear what?

Trinity:
Are you sure this line is clean?

Cypher:
Yeah, of course I'm sure.

Trinity:
I better go.

Agent Brown:
She got out.

Agent Smith:
Doesn't matter.

Agent Brown:
The informant is real.

Agent Smith:
Yes.

Agent Jones:
We have the name of their next target.

Agent Brown:
The name is Neo.

Agent Smith:
We'll need a search running.

Agent Jones:
It has already begun.

Neo:
What is happening to me?

Morpheus:
You are the One, Neo. You see, you may have spent the last few years looking for me, but I have spent my entire life looking for you.

Choi:
Hallelujah. You're my savior, man. My own personal Jesus Christ.

Neo:
If you get caught using that...

Choi:
I know. This never happened. You don't exist.

Neo:
Right.

Neo:
Hello?

Morpheus:
Hello, Neo. Do you know who this is?

Neo:
Morpheus?

Morpheus:
Yes. I've been looking for you, Neo. I don't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you, but unfortunately, you and I have run out of time. They're coming for you, Neo, and I don't know what they're going to do.

Neo:
Who's coming for me?

Morpheus:
Stand up and see for yourself.

Neo:
What, right now?

Morpheus:
Yes, now.

Switch:
Our way... or the highway.

Trinity:
Dodge this.

Morpheus:
This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back. You take the blue pill - the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill - you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit-hole goes.

Tank:
Door on your left.

Tank:
Your other left.

Cypher:
Neo. You scared the b'Jesus out of me.

Cypher:
No. I don't believe it.

Tank:
Believe it or not, you piece of sh*t, you're still gonna burn.

Neo:
Okey dokey... free my mind. Right, no problem, free my mind, free my mind, no problem, right...

Agent Smith:
The great Morpheus. We meet at last.

Morpheus:
And you are?

Agent Smith:
A Smith. Agent Smith.

Morpheus:
You all look the same to me.

Agent Smith:
I'm going to enjoy watching you die, Mr. Anderson.

Morpheus:
I've seen an agent punch through a concrete wall. Men have emptied entire clips at them and hit nothing but air, yet their strength and their speed are still based in a world that is built on rules. Because of that, they will never be as strong or as fast as you can be.

Neo:
I used to eat there. Really good noodles.

Tank:
We're supposed to start with these operation programs first. That's major boring sh*t. Let's do something a little more fun. How about... combat training.

Neo:
Ju jitsu? I'm gonna learn Ju jitsu.

Neo:
Holy sh*t!

Tank:
Hey Mikey, I think he likes it. How about some more?

Neo:
Hell, yes. Hell yeah.

Cypher:
All I see now is blonde, brunette, redhead.

Oracle:
Do you know what that means?

Oracle:
It means know thy self. I wanna tell you a little secret, being the one is just like being in love. No one needs to tell you you are in love, you just know it, through and through.

Trinity:
Neo, I'm not afraid anymore. The Oracle told me that I would fall in love and that that man... the man that I loved would be The One. So you see, you can't be dead. You can't be... because I love you. You hear me? I love you.

Trinity:
Now get up!

Cypher:
Jesus. What a mind-job.

Trinity:
What's he doing?

Morpheus:
He's beginning to believe.

Morpheus:
To your left there is a window: open it... use the scaffold to get to the roof.

Neo:
No way. No way. This is crazy.

Morpheus:
There are two ways out of that building: one is that scaffold, the other is in their custody. You take a chance either way: I leave it to you.

Morpheus:
Were you listening to me, Neo? Or were you looking at the woman in the red dress?

Cypher:
If you'd told us the truth, we would've told you to shove that red pill right up your ass.

Cypher:
By the way, if you have something terribly important to say to Switch, I'd suggest you say it now.

Trinity:
Oh, please God...

Switch:
Not like this. Not like this.

Cypher:
Too late!

Choi:
It just sounds to me like you need to unplug, man.

Agent Smith:
As you can see, we've had our eye on you for some time now, Mr. Anderson.

Morpheus:
What is the Matrix? Control. The Matrix is a computer-generated dream world built to keep us under control in order to change a human being into this.

Neo:
No, I don't believe it. It's not possible.

Morpheus:
I didn't say it would be easy, Neo. I just said it would be the truth.

Morpheus:
We've done it, Trinity. We've found him.

Trinity:
I hope you're right.

Morpheus:
You don't have to hope. I *know* it.

Rhineheart:
The time has come to make a choice, Mr. Anderson. Either you choose to be at your desk on time from this day forth, or you choose to find yourself another job.

Switch:
The digital pimp at work.

Agent Smith:
Dammit.

Agent Brown:
The trace was completed.

Agent Jones:
We have their position.

Agent Brown:
Sentinels are standing by.

Agent Jones:
Order the strike.

Agent Smith:
They are not out yet.

Morpheus:
How we doing Tank?

Tank:
Main power offline. EMP armed...

Tank:
and ready.

Neo:
EMP?

Trinity:
Electro-Magnetic Pulse, disables any electrical system within the blast radius, only weapon we have against the machines.

Morpheus:
Quiet.

Agent Smith:
Find them and destroy them

Agent Smith:
Check him.

Agent Brown:
He's gone.

Agent Smith:
Good bye, Mr Anderson.

Agent Smith:
Lieutenant, you were given specific orders.

Police Lieutenant:
Hey, I'm just doing my job. You give me that juris-my dick-tion crap, you can cram it up your ass.

Agent Smith:
The orders were for your protection.

Police Lieutenant:
[chuckles] I think we can handle one little girl. [Smith nods to Jones and Brown; the three walk to the hotel] I sent two units, they're bringing her down now.

Agent Smith:
No, lieutenant, your men are already dead.

Neo:
You ever get that feeling where you're not sure you're awake or still dreaming?

Choi:
Mmmm, all the time. It's called mescaline; it's the only way to fly. Hey, it sounds to me like you need to unplug, man. You know, get some R&R? What do you think DuJour? Should we bring him with us?

DuJour:
Definitely.

Neo:
I can't, I, uh, have work tomorrow.

DuJour:
Come on, it'll be fun. I promise.

[Neo starts to refuse, then notices a tattoo of a white rabbit on DuJour's shoulder, recalling the message of follow the white rabbit]

Neo:
...Yeah, sure, I'll go.

[Neo finds himself with Morpheus in a very much blank white room upon being jacked in for the first time]

Morpheus:
This is the Construct. It's our loading program. We can load anything, from clothing, to equipment, weapons, training simulations, anything we need.

Neo:
Right now we're inside a computer program?

Morpheus:
Is it really so hard to believe. Your clothes are different. The plugs in your arms and head are gone. Your hair has changed. Your appearance now is what we call residual self-image. It is the mental projection of your digital self.

Neo:
This...This isn't real?

Morpheus:
What is real? How do you define real? If you're talking about what you can feel, what you can smell, taste and see, then real is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain. [picks up a TV remote and turns on the TV to show images of the world as Neo saw it] This is the world that you know. The world as it was at the end of the 20th century. It exists now only as part of a neural-interactive simulation...that we call the Matrix. [turns off the TV] You've been living in a dream world, Neo. This is the world as it exists today. [The landscape shifts; now Morpheus and Neo sit in a devastated Earth] Welcome to the desert of the real. We have only bits and pieces of information. But what we know for certain is that at some point in the early 21st century all of mankind was united in celebration. We marveled at our own magnificence as we gave birth to A.I.

Neo:
A.I...You mean artificial intelligence.

Morpheus:
A singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of machines. We don't know who struck first, us or them. But we know that it was us that scorched the sky. At the time they were dependent on solar power and it was believed that they would be unable to survive without an energy source as abundant as the sun. Throughout human history, we have been dependent on machines to survive. Fate, it seems, is not without a sense of irony. The human body generates more bioelectricity than a 120-volt battery. And over 25,000 BTUs of body heat. Combined with a form of fusion. The machines had found all the energy they would ever need. There are fields, Neo, endless fields, where human beings are no longer born. We are grown. For the longest time, I wouldn't believe it. And then I saw the fields with my own eyes. Watched them liquefy the dead so they could be fed intravenously to the living. And standing there, facing the pure, horrifying precision. I came to realize the obviousness of the truth. What is the Matrix? Control. The Matrix is a computer-generated dream world built to keep us under control in order to change a human being into this. [holds up a Duracell battery]

Neo:
No, I don't believe it. It's not possible.

Morpheus:
I didn't say it would be easy, Neo. I just said it would be the truth.

Neo:
Stop! Let me out! LET ME OUT! I WANT OUT!

[Neo and Morpheus are walking down what appears to be a street in the Matrix]

Morpheus:
The Matrix is a system, Neo. That system is our enemy. But when you're inside, you look around, what do you see? Business men, teachers, lawyers, carpenters. The very minds of the people we are trying to save. But until we do, these people are still a part of that system, and that makes them our enemy. You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inured, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it. [Neo's attention is drawn to a passing attractive woman wearing a red dress] Were you listening to me, Neo, or were you looking at the woman in the red dress?

Neo:
I was…

Morpheus:
Look again. [Neo looks again; the woman has instantly turned into Agent Smith, pointing a gun at his head] Freeze it. [everything on the screen freezes in time]

Neo:
This…this isn't the Matrix?

Morpheus:
No. It's another training program designed to teach you one thing: if you are not one of us, you are one of them.

Neo:
What are they?

Morpheus:
Sentient programs. They can move in and out of any software still hard-wired to their system. That means that anyone we haven't unplugged is potentially an Agent. Inside the Matrix, they are everyone and they are no one. We have survived by hiding from them, by running from them, but they are the gatekeepers. They are guarding all the doors, they are holding all the keys, which means that sooner or later, someone is going to have to fight them.

Neo:
Someone?

Morpheus:
I won't lie to you, Neo. Every single man or woman who has stood their ground, everyone who has fought an agent has died. But where they have failed, you will succeed.

Neo:
Why?

Morpheus:
I've seen an agent punch through a concrete wall. Men have emptied entire clips at them and hit nothing but air. Yet their strength and their speed are still based in a world that is built on rules. Because of that, they will never be as strong or as fast as you can be.

Neo:
What are you trying to tell me, that I can dodge bullets?

Morpheus:
No, Neo. I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready, you won't have to.

[Morpheus and Neo are in a sparring program; Morpheus has beaten him]

Agent Smith:
[he and Cypher are eating at a fancy restaurant] Do we have a deal, Mr. Reagan?

Cypher:
[cuts a piece of steak; holds it in front of him] Y’know, I know this steak doesn't exist. I know that when I put it in my mouth, the Matrix is telling my brain that it is juicy and delicious. After nine years, you know what I realize? [eats the piece of steak; sighs contently] Ignorance is bliss.

Agent Smith:
Then we have a deal?

Cypher:
I don't wanna remember nothing. Nothing, you understand? And I wanna be rich. Y’know, someone important…like an actor.

Agent Smith:
Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan.

Cypher:
Okay. Get my body back into a power plant, re-insert me into the Matrix, I'll get you what you want.

Agent Smith:
Access codes to the Zion mainframe.

Cypher:
No, I told you, I don't know them. I can get you the man who does.

Agent Smith:
Morpheus.

[After Cypher blasts Tank and Dozer with a lightning rifle]

Cypher:
Hello, Trinity.

Trinity:
Cypher? Where's Tank?

Cypher:
[leaning over her plugged body] You know, for a long time, I thought I was in love with you. I used to dream about you. You're a beautiful woman, Trinity. Too bad things had to turn out this way.

Trinity:
You killed them.

Apoc:
What?

Switch:
Oh God...

Cypher:
I'm tired, Trinity. Tired of this war, tired of fighting, tired of this ship, being cold, eatin’ the same goddamn goop every day. But most of all, I'm tired of that jackoff and all of his bullshit. [climbs onto the plugged Morpheus] Surprise, a**hole! I betcha never saw this comin’, did ya? God, I wish I could be there, when they break ya. I wish I could be there just when it happens, so right then, you'd know it was me.

Trinity:
You gave them Morpheus.

Cypher:
He lied to us, Trinity! He tricked us! If you woulda told us the truth, we woulda told you to shove that red pill right up your ass!

Trinity:
That is not true, Cypher, he set us free.

Cypher:
Free? You call this free? All I do is what he tells me to do. If I had to choose between that and the Matrix, I'd choose the Matrix.

Trinity:
The Matrix isn't real!

Cypher:
I disagree, Trinity. I think that the Matrix can be more real than this world. All I do is pull the plug here, but there... you have to watch Apoc die.

Apoc:
[as Trinity looks at him in horror] Trinity... [Cypher pulls his plug and he falls, dead]

Switch:
[running to Apoc's body] No!

Cypher:
Welcome to the real world, huh, baby?

Trinity:
But you're out, Cypher, you can't go back.

Cypher:
Oh no, that's what you think. They're gonna reinsert my body, I go back to sleep, and when I wake up, I won't remember a goddamn thing. By the way, if you have something terribly important to say to Switch, I suggest you say it now.

Trinity:
Oh no, please don't...

Switch:
Not like this. Not like this. [dies as Cypher pulls her plug]

Cypher:
Too late.

Trinity:
Goddamn you, Cypher!

Cypher:
Don't hate me, Trinity. I'm just a messenger. And right now, I'm gonna prove it to you. [walking to the plugged Neo] If Morpheus was right, then there's no way I can pull this plug. I mean if Neo is the One, then there'd have to be some kind of a miracle to stop me. Right? I mean, how can he be the One if he's dead? You never did answer me before. You bought into Morpheus' bullshit. Come on. All I want is a little yes or no. Look into his eyes, those big pretty eyes, and tell me - yes or no?

Trinity:
[looks at Neo, tears slightly visible in her eyes] Yes.

Cypher:
No! I don't believe it!

[A recovering Tank is aiming the lightning rifle at him]

Tank:
Believe it or not, you piece of sh*t, you're still gonna burn! [blasts Cypher, killing him]

Trinity:
What are you doing?

Neo:
I'm going in.

Trinity:
No, you're not.

Neo:
I have to.

Trinity:
Neo, Morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out. There is no way you're going back in.

Neo:
Morpheus did what he did because he believes something I'm not.

Trinity:
What?

Neo:
I'm not The One, Trinity. The Oracle hit me with that too.

Trinity:
No, you have to be.

Neo:
I'm sorry, I'm not. I'm just another guy.

Trinity:
No, Neo, that's not true. It can't be true.

Neo:
Why?

[no response, Neo walks away again]

Tank:
Neo, this is loco. They've got Morpheus in a military-controlled building. Even if you somehow got inside, those are agents holding him. Three of them. I want Morpheus back too but what you're talking about is suicide.

Neo:
I know that's what it looks like, but it's not. I can't explain to you why it's not. Morpheus believes in something and he was ready to give his life, I understand that now. That's why I have to go.

Tank:
Why?

Neo:
Because I believe in something.

Trinity:
What?

Neo:
I believe I can bring him back.

Morpheus:
Fate, it seems, is not without a sense of irony.

Morpheus:
Come on! Stop trying to hit me and hit me!

Morpheus:
Don't think you are, know you are.

Cypher:
Ignorance is bliss.

Mr. Wizard. Get me the hell out here.

Neo:
Why don't you tell me what's on your mind, Councillor?

Councillor Harmann:
There is so much in this world that I do not understand. See that machine? It has something to do with recycling our water supply. I have absolutely no idea how it works. But I do understand the reason for it to work. I have absolutely no idea how you are able to do some of the things you do, but I believe there's a reason for that as well. I only hope we understand that reason before it's too late.

Trinity:
You always told me to stay off the freeway.

Morpheus:
Yes, that's true.

Trinity:
You said it was suicide.

Morpheus:
Then let us hope that I was wrong.

Neo:
Trinity. I know you can hear me. I'm never letting go. I can't. I just love you too damn much.

Commander Lock:
Dammit, Morpheus. Not everyone believes what you believe.

Morpheus:
My beliefs do not require them to.

Neo:
There are only two possible explanations: either no one told me, or no one knows.

The Oracle:
Do you see her die?

Neo:
No.

The Oracle:
You have the sight now, Neo. You are looking at the world without time.

Neo:
Then why can't I see what happens to her?

The Oracle:
We can never see past the choices we don't understand.

Neo:
Are you saying I have to choose whether Trinity lives or dies?

The Oracle:
No, you've already made the choice. Now you have to understand it.

Neo:
No. I can't do that. I won't.

The Oracle:
Well, you have to.

Neo:
Why?

The Oracle:
Because you're the One.

Agent Smith:
The best thing about being me... There are so many mes.

Morpheus:
...and after a century of war I remember that which matters most: we are still HERE.

Morpheus:
Tonight let us make them remember: This is ZION, and we ARE NOT AFRAID.

Seraph:
You seek the Oracle.

Neo:
Who are you?

Seraph:
I am Seraph. I can take you to her. But first, I must apologize.

Neo:
For what?.

Seraph:
For this.

Twin #1:
We are getting aggravated.

Twin #2:
Yes, we are.

Bane:
Oh God.

Agent Smith:
Smith will suffice.

Merovingian:
I love French wine, like I the French language. I have sampled every language, French is my favorite. Fantastic language. Especially to curse with. Nom de dieu de putain de bordel de merde de saloperie de connard d'enculé de ta mère. It's like wiping your arse with silk. I love it.

Seraph:
The Oracle has many enemies, I had to be sure.

Neo:
Of what?

Seraph:
That you were The One.

Neo:
You could've just asked.

Seraph:
You do not truly know someone until you fight them.

The Architect:
Hello, Neo.

Neo:
Who are you?

The Architect:
I am the Architect. I created the Matrix. I've been waiting for you. You have many questions, and although the process has altered your consciousness, you remain irrevocably human. Ergo, some of my answers you will understand, and some of them you will not. Concordantly, while your first question may be the most pertinent, you may or may not realize it is also the most irrelevant.

The Keymaker:
I've been waiting for you.

The Architect:
You are here because Zion is about to be destroyed. Its every living inhabitant terminated, its entire existence eradicated.

Neo:
Bullshit.

The Architect:
Denial is the most predictable of all human responses. But, rest assured, this will be the sixth time we have destroyed it, and we have become exceedingly efficient at it.

The Architect:
There are levels of survival we are prepared to accept. However, the relevant issue is whether or not you are ready to accept the responsibility for the death of every human being in this world.

Neo:
If I were you, I would hope we don't meet again.

The Architect:
We won't.

Neo:
But if you already know, how can I make a choice?

The Oracle:
Because you didn't come here to make the choice, you've already made it. You're here to try to understand *why* you made it. I thought you'd have figured that out by now.

Morpheus:
I have dreamed a dream, but now that dream is gone from me.

The Oracle:
So, let's get the obvious stuff out of the way.

Neo:
You're not human, are you?

The Oracle:
It's tough to get any more obvious than that.

The Oracle:
It seems that every time we meet, I have nothing but bad news. I'm sorry about that, I surely am. But for what it's worth, you've made a believer out of me. Good luck, kiddo.

Neo:
Are there other programs like you?

The Oracle:
Oh, well, not like me. But... look, see those birds? At some point a program was written to govern them. A program was written to watch over the trees, and the wind, the sunrise, and sunset. There are programs running all over the place. The ones doing their job, doing what they were meant to do, are invisible. You'd never even know they were here. But the other ones, well, we hear about them all the time.

Neo:
I've never heard of them.

The Oracle:
Oh, of course you have. Every time you've heard someone say they saw a ghost, or an angel. Every story you've ever heard about vampires, werewolves, or aliens, is the system assimilating some program that's doing something they're not supposed to be doing.

Councillor Harmann:
I hate sleeping. I figured, I've slept the first eleven years of my life away, so now I'm just making up for it.

Trinity:
Touch me and that hand will never touch anything again.

Neo:
Hmm, upgrades.

Commander Lock:
If it were up to me, Captain, you wouldn't set foot on a ship for the rest of your life.

Morpheus:
Then I am grateful that it is not up to you.

Persephone:
...just a sample.

Trinity:
How about you sample this instead?

Neo:
I suppose the most obvious question is, how can I trust you?

The Oracle:
Bingo. It is a pickle. No doubt about it. The bad news is there's no way if you can really know whether I'm here to help you or not, so it's really up to you. You just have to make up you on damned mind to either accept what I'm going to tell you, or reject it.

The Keymaker:
We do only what we're meant to do.

Agent Johnson:
Then you are meant for one more thing: deletion.

Trinity:
That's a nice trick.

Merovingian:
Okay, you have some skill.

Agent Smith:
I killed you, Mr. Anderson. I watched you die... with a certain satisfaction, I might add. Then something happened. something that I knew was impossible, but it happened anyway. You destroyed me, Mr. Anderson. After that, I understood the rules, I knew what I was supposed to do, but I didn't. I couldn't. I was compelled to stay, compelled to disobey. And now, here I stand because of you, Mr. Anderson. Because of you, I'm no longer an Agent of this system. Because of you, I've changed. I'm unplugged. A new man, so to speak. Like you, apparently, free.

Neo:
Congratulations.

Agent Smith:
Thank you.

Merovingian:
Oh my god Persephone, how could you do this? You betrayed me.

Persephone:
Cause and Effect, my love.

Merovingian:
Cause? There is no cause for this. What cause?

Persephone:
What cause? How about the lipstick you're still wearing?

Merovingian:
Lipstick? Lipstick? Heh, what craziness are you talking about woman? There is no lipstick.

Persephone:
She wasn't kissing your face, my love.

The Oracle:
Candy?

Neo:
Do you already know if I'm going to take it?

The Oracle:
Wouldn't be much of an Oracle if I didn't.

Agent Smith:
If you can't beat us...

Agent Smith Clone:
...join us.

Neo:
Why are you here?

The Oracle:
Same reason. I love candy.

The Architect:
Humph. Hope, it is the quintessential human delusion, simultaneously the source of your greatest strength, and your greatest weakness.

Neo:
Choice, the problem is choice.

The Architect:
As I was saying, she stumbled upon a solution whereby nearly ninety-nine percent of the test subjects accepted the program provided they were given a choice - even if they were only aware of it at a near-unconscious level. While this solution worked, it was fundamentally flawed, creating the otherwise contradictory systemic anomaly, that, if left unchecked, might threaten the system itself. Ergo, those who refused the program, while a minority, would constitute an escalating probability of disaster.

Neo:
This is about Zion.

The Architect:
There are two doors. The door to your right leads to the Source and the salvation of Zion. The door to your left leads back to the Matrix, to her... and to the end of your species. As you adequately put, the problem is choice. But we already know what you are going to do, don't we? Already I can see the chain reaction: the chemical precursors that signal the onset of an emotion, designed specifically to overwhelm logic and reason. An emotion that is already blinding you to the simple and obvious truth: she is going to die and there is nothing you can do to stop it.

Agent Smith:
But, as you well know, appearances can be deceiving, which brings me back to the reason why we're here. We're not here because we're free. We're here because we're not free. There is no escaping reason; no denying purpose. Because as we both know, without purpose, we would not exist.

Agent Smith Clone 1:
It is purpose that created us.

Agent Smith Clone 2:
Purpose that connects us.

Agent Smith Clone 3:
Purpose that pulls us.

Agent Smith Clone 4:
That guides us.

Agent Smith Clone 5:
That drives us.

Agent Smith Clone 6:
It is purpose that defines us.

Agent Smith Clone 7:
Purpose that binds us.

Agent Smith:
We are here because of you, Mr Anderson. We're here to take from you what you tried to take from us.

Agent Smith:
Purpose.

Morpheus:
What is it, Niobe?

Niobe:
I can't help it, Morpheus, I can't help thinking, what if you're wrong? What if all this, the prophecy, everything is bullshit?

Trinity:
Is Neo okay?

Link:
Okay? Sh*t, Morpheus, you should have seen him.

Morpheus:
Where is he now?

Link:
He's doin' his Superman thing.

Agent Smith:
I'm looking for Neo.

Corrupt:
Never heard of him.

Agent Smith:
I have something for him, a gift. You see, he set me free...

Corrupt:
Fine, whatever. Now, piss off.

Agent Smith:
I want everything.

Morpheus:
Would that include a bullet from this gun?

Neo:
Hiya, fellas.

Agent Jackson:
It's him.

Agent Thompson:
The anomaly.

Agent Jackson:
Do we proceed?

Agent Thompson:
Yes...

Agent Jackson:
...he is still...

Agent Johnson:
...only human.

Merovingian:
Mark my words boy, Mark them well, I have survived your predecessors and I will survive you.

The Keymaker:
There is a building. Inside this building there is a level where no elevator can go, and no stair can reach. This level is filled with doors. These doors lead to many places. Hidden places. But one door is special. One door leads to the source.

Agent Smith:
Mr. Anderson. Surprised to see me?

Neo:
No.

Agent Smith:
Then you're aware of it?

Neo:
Of what?

Agent Smith:
Our connection.

Agent Smith:
You look surprised to see me, again, Mr. Anderson. That's the difference between us. I've been *expecting* you.

Agent Smith:
Mister Anderson, you look surprised to see me, again.

Link:
Where's my puss. . .Hey.

Trinity:
I guess this makes us even.

Neo:
Why am I here?

The Architect:
Your life is the sum of a remainder of an unbalanced equation inherent to the programming of the matrix. You are the eventuality of an anomaly, which despite my sincerest efforts I have been unable to eliminate from what is otherwise a harmony of mathematical precision. While it remains a burden assiduously avoided, it is not unexpected, and thus not beyond a measure of control. Which has led you, inexorably, here.

Neo:
You haven't answered my question.

The Architect:
Quite right. Interesting. That was quicker than the others.

The Architect:
The function of the One is now to return to the source, allowing a temporary dissemination of the code you carry, reinserting the prime program. After which you will be required to select from the matrix 23 individuals, 16 female, 7 male, to rebuild Zion. Failure to comply with this process will result in a cataclysmic system crash killing everyone connected to the matrix, which coupled with the extermination of Zion will ultimately result in the extinction of the entire human race.

Neo:
You won't let it happen, you can't. You need human beings to survive.

Neo:
Well, that didn't go so well.

Morpheus:
Are you Certain the Oracle didn't say anything else?

Neo:
Yes.

Trinity:
Maybe we did something wrong.

Neo:
Or didn't do something.

Morpheus:
No, what happened, happened and couldn't have happened any other way.

Neo:
How do you know?

Morpheus:
We are still alive.

Agent Smith:
That went as expected...

Agent Smith Clone:
Yes.

Agent Smith:
It's all happening exactly as before...

Agent Smith Clone:
Well, not exactly...

Morpheus:
Smith?

Morpheus:
Now there's more than one of him?

Neo:
A lot more.

Link:
But how? How can that be possible?

Neo:
I don't know. Somehow he's found a way to copy himself.

Morpheus:
Was that what he was doing to you?

Neo:
I don't know what he was doing. But I remember what it felt like.

Trinity:
What?

Neo:
It felt like I was back in that hallway... it felt like dying.

Merovingian:
Goddammit woman, you will be the end of me.

Morpheus:
What can you see, Neo?

Neo:
It's strange... the code is somehow different.

Morpheus:
Encrypted?

Neo:
Maybe.

Trinity:
Is that good for us, or bad for us?

Neo:
Well, it looks like every floor is wired with explosives.

Trinity:
Bad for us.

Morpheus:
Here we go.

Merovingian:
And now I have some real business to attend to, so I will say adieu and goodbye...

Neo:
This isn't over.

Merovingian:
Oh, yes it is. The Keymaker is mine and I see no reason to give him up... No reason at all...

Morpheus:
All of our lives, we have fought this war. Tonight I believe we can end it. Tonight is not an accident. There are no accidents. We have not come here by chance. I do not believe in chance. When I see three objectives, three captains, three ships. I do not see coincidence, I see providence. I see purpose. I believe it our fate to be here. It is our destiny. I believe this night holds for each and every one of us, the very meaning of our lives.

Morpheus:
This is a war and we are soldiers. Death can come for us at any time, in any place.

Morpheus:
. Now consider the alternative. What if I am right? What if the prophecy is true? What if tomorrow the war could be over? Isn't that worth fighting for? Isn't that worth dying for?

Link:
Trinity, we're talking less then 5 minutes here.

Trinity:
In five minutes, I'll tear that whole goddamn building down.

Neo:
I can't lose you.

Trinity:
You're not going to lose me.

Trinity:
You feel this? I'm never letting go.

Morpheus:
Link?

Link:
Yessir?

Morpheus:
Given your situation, I can't say I fully understand your reasons for volunteering to operate on my ship. However, if you wish to continue to do so, I must ask you to do one thing.

Link:
What's that, sir?

Morpheus:
...To trust me.

Link:
Yessir. I will, sir.

Link:
I mean, I do, sir.

Neo:
What happens if I fail?

The Oracle:
Then Zion will fall.

Neo:
I just haven't been able to sleep much.

Councillor Harmann:
It's a good sign.

Neo:
Of what?

Councillor Harmann:
That you are, in fact, still human.

Persephone:
I envy you. But such a thing is not meant to last.

Neo:
What does he want?

The Oracle:
What do all men with power want? More power.

Morpheus:
A Sentinel for every man, woman, and child in Zion. That sounds *exactly* like the thinking of a machine to me.

Morpheus:
And does the Commander have a plan for dealing with two hundred and fifty *thousand* Sentinels?

Niobe:
A strategy is still being formulated.

Morpheus:
I'm sure it is.

Zion Virtual Control Operator:
Door's open, bed's made. Welcome home.

Link:
No place like it.

Neo:
What happened?

Trinity:
Morpheus went to the Oracle. After that everything changed.

Neo:
Yeah. She can do that.

Neo:
How long to recharge the Neb?

Trinity:
24, maybe 30, hours.

Neo:
Some people go their entire lives without hearing news that good.

Niobe:
I remember. I remember when you used to dance. I remember you were... pretty good.

Morpheus:
There are some things in this world, Captain Niobe, that will never change.

Commander Lock:
Niobe.

Morpheus:
Some things do change.

Councillor Harmann:
I like to be reminded this city survives because of these machines. These machines keep us alive, while other machines are coming to kill us. Interesting, isn't it? The power to give life, and the power to end it.

Link:
All I know is that ship needs an operator. And right now that operator's me.

Commander Lock:
I believe I'm going to need every ship we have if we're going to survive this attack.

Councillor Harmann:
I understand that, Commander.

Commander Lock:
Then why did you allow the Nebuchanezar to leave?

Councillor Harmann:
Because *I* believe our survival depends on more than how many *ships* we have.

Merovingian:
Something to eat? Drink? Of course these things are contrivances, like so much here, for the sake of appearances.

Neo:
No thankyou.

Merovingian:
Yes, of course. Who has time? Who has time? But then if we never *take* time, how can we have time?

Merovingian:
The question is, do *you* know why you are here?

Morpheus:
We are looking for the Keymaker.

Merovingian:
Oh, yes. It is true. The Keymaker. Of course. But this is not a reason. This is not a why. The Keymaker himself - his very nature is a means. It is not an end. And so to look for him is to be looking for a means to do... what?

Merovingian:
You see there is only one constant. One universal. It is the only real truth. Causality. Action, reaction. Cause and effect.

Persephone:
They come from a much older version of the Matrix, but like so many back then they caused more problems than they solved. My husband saved them because they are notoriously difficult to terminate. How many people keep silver bullets in their gun?

Merovingian:
You see: he's just a man.

Trinity:
Where are you going?

The Keymaker:
Another way. Always another way.

Morpheus:
Neo, if you're out there I could use some help.

The Keymaker:
Only the One can open the door. And only during that window can that door be opened.

Niobe:
How do *you* know all this?

The Keymaker:
I know because I *must* know. It is my purpose. It is the reason I am here. The same reason we are *all* here.

The Keymaker:
If one fails, all fail.

The Architect:
The first matrix I designed was quite naturally perfect. It was a work of art. Flawless. Sublime. A triumph only equaled by its monumental failure.

Ballard:
You're asking for one of us to disobey a direct order.

Morpheus:
That's right, I am. But we all well know that the reason that most of us are here is because of our... affinity for disobedience.

Link:
That's the closest I can get you, you better grow some wings.

Merovingian:
What is the reason? Soon the why and the reason are gone and all that matters is the feeling. This is the nature of the universe. We struggle against it, we fight to deny it; but it is of course a lie. Beneath our poised appearance we are completely out of control.

Persephone:
Where are you going?

Merovingian:
Please, ma cherie. I have told you. We are all victims of causality. I drank too much wine, I must take a piss. Cause and effect.

The Architect:
It is interesting reading your reactions. Your five predecessors were, by design, based on a similar predication: a contingent affirmation that was meant to create a profound attachment to the rest of your species, facilitating the function of the One. While the others experienced this in a general way, your experience is far more specific. Vis-à-vis: love.

Neo:
Trinity.

The Architect:
Apropos, she entered the Matrix to save your life at the cost of her own.

Neo:
No...

The Architect:
Which brings us at last to the moment of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw is ultimately expressed, and the Anomaly revealed as both beginning... and end.

Councillor Hamann:
That's how it is with people - nobody cares how it works as long as it works.

Link:
Goddamn, it's good to be home again.

Power Station Guard #1:
Hey. You count sheep at home.

Security Bunker Guard #2:
Why? You get paid to count 'em here.

Merovingian:
Choice is an illusion created between those with power and those without.

Agent Smith:
Mr. Anderson. Welcome back, we missed you.

Agent Smith:
Like what I've done with the place?

Neo:
It ends tonight.

Agent Smith:
I know it does, I've seen it. That's why the rest of me is just going to enjoy the show because we already know that I'm the one that beats you.

Deus Ex Machina:
It is done.

Niobe:
Neo.

Morpheus:
He fights for us.

Ghost:
Well it's nice to have something to look forward to.

Niobe:
Indeed it is.

The Oracle:
Everything that has a beginning has an end. I see the end coming, I see the darkness spreading. I see death... and you are all that stands in his way. If you cannot stop him tonight, then I fear tomorrow will never come.

Neo:
I can see you.

Neo:
I just have never...

Rama-Kandra:
...heard a program speak of love?

Neo:
It's a... human emotion.

Rama-Kandra:
No, it is a word. What matters is the connection the word implies. I see that you are in love. Can you tell me what you would give to hold on to that connection?

Neo:
Anything.

Rama-Kandra:
Then perhaps the reason you're here is not so different from the reason I'm here.

Neo:
The program Smith has grown beyond your control. Soon he will spread through this city, as he has spread through the Matrix. You cannot stop him... but I can.

Neo:
What do you want?

Bane:
I want what you want... Yes. That's it, Mr. Anderson. Look past the flesh. Look through the soft gelatin of these dull cow eyes and see your enemy!

Neo:
...No.

Bane:
Oh yes, Mr. Anderson.

Neo:
It can't be...

Bane:
There's nowhere I can't go. There's nowhere I won't find you.

Neo:
It's impossible...!

Bane:
Not impossible. Inevitable. Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.

Merovingian:
Bring me the eyes of the oracle. Then I will give you back your savior.

The Oracle:
Tonight, the future of both worlds will be in your hands... or in his.

Morpheus:
You've never believed in The One.

Niobe:
I still don't. I believe in him.

Trinity:
If you tell me we'll make it I'll believe you.

Neo:
We'll make it. We have to.

Morpheus:
I don't know what he can do to save us. But I do know that as long as there is a single breath left in his body he will not give up and neither can we.

Neo:
It's impossible.

Bane:
Not impossible. Inevitable.

Sati:
The Oracle told me about you.

Agent Smith:
Really? What did she say about me?

Sati:
That you were a bad man.

Agent Smith:
Oh, I'm not so bad, once you get to know me

Mifune:
If we have to give these bastards our lives, we give them hell before we do!

Agent Smith:
Why, Mr. Anderson? Why do you do it? Why get up? Why keep fighting? Do you believe you're fighting for something? For more that your survival? Can you tell me what it is? Do you even know? Is it freedom? Or truth? Perhaps peace? Yes? No? Could it be for love? Illusions, Mr. Anderson. Vagaries of perception. The temporary constructs of a feeble human intellect trying desperately to justify an existence that is without meaning or purpose. And all of them as artificial as the Matrix itself, although only a human mind could invent something as insipid as love. You must be able to see it, Mr. Anderson. You must know it by now. You can't win. It's pointless to keep fighting. Why, Mr. Anderson? Why? Why do you persist?

Neo:
Because I choose to.

Agent Smith:
Can you feel it Mr. Anderson? Closing in on you? Oh I can, I really should thank you after all. It was, after all, it was your life that taught me the purpose of all life. Purpose of life is to end.

Trinity:
Do you know what happened to Neo?

The Oracle:
He is trapped in a place between this world and the machine world. All I can do is tell you that your friend needs your help. He needs all our help.

Agent Smith:
This is my world.

Roland:
This is asinine. If you want to kill yourself, go ahead, but do it without wasting one of our ships.

Neo:
You have to believe me. I have to go.

Roland:
Bullshit. I'm captain of this ship, *I'll* say where it has to go. And believe me, this ship will go to hell long before I let you take it anywhere!

Niobe:
He can have mine.

Roland:
Niobe! You can't do that!

Niobe:
Don't you even begin to tell me what I can and can't do with my ship after your little speech.

Seraph:
So be it.

Bane:
I wish you could see the look on your face right now...

Trinity:
I don't have time for this sh*t.

Trinity:
How's this for a deal? You give me Neo, or we all die, right here, right now.

Neo:
Sh*t.

Mifune:
What the sh*t is goin on over here?

The Oracle:
You are a bastard.

Agent Smith:
You would know, Mom.

Mifune:
What's a little pod-born pencil-neck doing volunteering for my corps?

Seraph:
Did you always know?

The Oracle:
Oh, no. No, I didn't. But I believed... I believed.

Niobe:
What are they doing?

Niobe:
What are *you* doing?

Trinity:
Six hours ago, I was ready to give my life for you. Do you know what has changed in the last six hours?

Neo:
No.

Trinity:
Nothing.

Neo:
It's been an honor, sir.

Morpheus:
No. The honor is still mine.

Trinity:
Here's another deal. You give me Neo, or we all die right here, right now.

the Merovingian:
Interesting deal... Are you really willing to die for this man?

Trinity:
Believe it.

Persephone:
If she has to, she will kill every one of us. She's in love.

Trinity:
Time's up. What's it gonna be, Merv?

The Oracle:
What about the others?

The Architect:
...What others?

The Oracle:
The ones that want out.

The Architect:
Obviously they shall be freed.

The Oracle:

The Architect:
What do you think I am? Human?

Neo:
One way or another, I'm getting on this train.

Niobe:

Neo:
You were right Smith. You're always right. It was inevitable.

Neo:
Who are you?

Bane:
Still don't recognize me? I admit it is difficult to even think encased in this rotting piece of meat. The stink of it filling every breath, a suffocating cloud you can't escape. Disgusting. How pathetically fragile it is. Nothing this weak is meant to survive.

The Architect:
You played a very dangerous game.

The Oracle:
Change always is.

Kid:
Neo, I believe.

Seraph:
There are no weapons allowed in this club. At the bottom of this elevator there is a coat check girl and, if we are lucky, a man to check weapons.

Trinity:
And if we are unlucky?

Seraph:
Then there will be many men.

Bane:
There is nowhere I can't go, there is nowhere I won't find you.

Persephone:
She'll do it. She'll kill every one of us if she has to... she's in love.

Roland:
Holy Christ, I didn't know she could do that.

Kid:
The machines don't care how old I am. They'll kill me anyway.

Mifune:
Ain't that the goddamn truth!

Kid:
Please, Captain Mifune, give me a chance. I won't let you down.

Mifune:
You do, and you're gonna find that me and the machines got something in common.

Neo:
I'm all right, Trin... but I think you're gonna have to drive.

Morpheus:
You saw the Oracle? What did she tell you?

Niobe:
Same thing she always does: exactly what I needed to hear.

Lock:
Three captains, one ship. I assume the other two were lost under equally pointless circumstances?

Niobe:
Nice to see you, too, Jason.

Lock:
The council wants to meet with you immediately. You'll forgive me for not attending, but I need to find a way to salvage this debacle.

Roland:
Did I miss something here? We just saved the dock.

Lock:
That's the problem with you people. You can't think more than five minutes in front of your faces. That EMP knocked out every turret and APU we still had up there. If I were the machines, I'd send every sentinel I had over here right now. Saved the dock? No, you just handed it to them on a silver platter!

AgentSmith:
The great and powerful Oracle. We meet at last. I suppose you've been expecting me, right? The all-knowing Oracle is never surprised. How can she be, she knows everything. But If that's true, then why is she here? If she knew I was coming, why didn't she leave?

Agent Smith:
Maybe you knew I was going to do that, maybe you didn't. If you did, that means you baked those cookies and set that plate right there deliberately, purposefully. Which means you're sitting there also deliberately, purposefully.

Oracle:
What did you do with Sati?

Agent Smith/Sati:
Cookies need love like everything does.

Oracle:
You are a bastard, you know that?

AgentSmith:
You would know, Mom.

Agent Smith:
It isn't fair.

Bane:
What's that for?

Maggie:
To help you relax. To make it easier for you to remember.

Bane:
What if I don't want to remember?

Maggie:
Why would you want that?

Bane:
What if I blew that EMP? What if I did destroy those ships and I am responsible for the deaths of all those men? If I did that, it wouldn't be very safe for me here, would it?

Bane:
Of course, it might not be very safe for you, either.

Bane:
Somehow familiar, isn't it? We've been here before, you and I. Do you remember? I do. I think of nothing else.

Trinity:
I wish I hadn't. That was my last thought. I wished I had one more chance, to say what really mattered, to say how much I loved you, how grateful I was for every moment I was with you. But by the time

Trinity:
said what I wanted to, it was too late. But you brought me back. You gave me my wish. One more chance to say what I really wanted to say... Kiss me, once more. Kiss me.

Bane:
Ah, Mr. Anderson, I see you are as predictable in this world as you are in the other.

Neo:
What?

Trinity:
He's out of his mind.

Bane:
It may appear that way to you, but Mr. Anderson and I know that appearances can be deceiving.

Merovingian:
It is remarkable how similar the pattern of love is to the pattern of insanity.

Roland:
This is asinine. If you want to kill yourself, go ahead, but do it without wasting one of our ships.

Neo:
You have to believe me. I have to go.

Roland:
Bullshit. I'm captain of this ship, *I'll* say where it has to go. And believe me, this ship will go to hell long before I let you take it anywhere!

Trinity:
Do it, Neo.

Bane:

Roland:
'Bout time we had some goddamned good news...

Councillor Dillard:
Commander, do you think that we have any chance of survivng?

Lock:
If I were you Councilor, I wouldn't ask me that question.

Lock:
I would ask him.

Councillor Dillard:
Why?

Lock:
Because *he's* the one that believes in miracles.

Lock's Lieutenant:
Sir, their EMP could take out every sentinel up there.

Lock:
It could take out more than that. It'll wipe out our entire defense system. If we blow an EMP inside there we'll lose the dock.

Lock's Lieutenant:
Sir, we *already* lost the dock.

Niobe:
He can have mine.

Roland:
You can't do that!

Niobe:
Don't you even begin to tell me what I can and can't do with my ship after your little speech.

Morpheus:
I have imagined this moment for a long time. Is it real?

Rama-Kandra:
That is our karma.

Neo:
You believe in karma?

Rama-Kandra:
Karma's a word. Like love. A way of saying 'what I am here to do.' I do not resent my karma - I'm grateful for it. Grateful for my wonderful wife, for my beautiful daughter. They are gifts. And so I do what I must do to honour them.

Trinity:
You wanna make a deal? How about this, you give me Neo or we all die right here, right now.

00:27:58,386 --> 00:28:00,930
You can feel it when you go to work...

310
00:28:02,473 --> 00:28:04,142
...when you go to church...

311
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,644
...when you pay your taxes.

312
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:10,690
It is the world that has been
pulled over your eyes...

313
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,525
...to blind you from the truth.

314
00:28:14,736 --> 00:28:15,987
What truth?

315
00:28:20,241 --> 00:28:21,784
That you are a slave.

316
00:28:23,286 --> 00:28:25,580
Like everyone else,
you were born into bondage...

317
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:30,501
...born into a prison that you cannot
smell or taste or touch.

318
00:28:30,793 --> 00:28:32,086
A prison...

319
00:28:32,337 --> 00:28:33,463
...for your mind.

320
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,805
Unfortunately, no one can be...

321
00:28:43,139 --> 00:28:45,516
...told what the Matrix is.

322
00:28:48,978 --> 00:28:50,855
You have to see it for yourself.

323
00:29:00,365 --> 00:29:02,659
This is your last chance.

324
00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:05,245
After this, there is no turning back.

325
00:29:05,703 --> 00:29:07,163
You take the blue pill...

326
00:29:07,497 --> 00:29:10,541
...the story ends, you wake up
in your bed and believe...

327
00:29:10,792 --> 00:29:12,585
...whatever you want to believe.

328
00:29:12,835 --> 00:29:14,170
You take the red pill...

329
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,381
...you stay in Wonderland...

330
00:29:16,881 --> 00:29:19,592
...and I show you how deep
the rabbit hole goes.

331
00:29:29,477 --> 00:29:30,687
Remember...

332
00:29:31,521 --> 00:29:34,565
...all I'm offering is the truth.
Nothing more.

333
00:29:48,871 --> 00:29:50,206
Follow me.

334
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,419
Apoc, are we on-line?

335
00:29:54,669 --> 00:29:56,045
APOC:
Almost.

336
00:29:59,382 --> 00:30:01,426
MORPHEUS:
Time is always against us.

337
00:30:01,801 --> 00:30:03,303
Please take a seat there.

338
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:23,197
- You did all this?
TRINITY: Mm-hm.

339
00:30:27,327 --> 00:30:29,329
The pill you took is
part of a trace program.

340
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:34,709
It disrupts your carrier signals
so we can pinpoint your location.

341
00:30:35,251 --> 00:30:36,294
What does that mean?

342
00:30:36,878 --> 00:30:39,047
It means buckle your
seat belt, Dorothy...

343
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,715
...because Kansas...

344
00:30:40,965 --> 00:30:42,008
...is going bye-bye.

345
00:31:19,921 --> 00:31:21,297
Did you...?

346
00:31:32,308 --> 00:31:36,396
Have you ever had a dream, Neo,
that you were so sure was real?

347
00:31:37,855 --> 00:31:40,441
What if you were unable
to wake from that dream?

348
00:31:40,691 --> 00:31:43,194
How would you know the difference
between the dream world...

349
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,238
...and the real world?

350
00:31:46,864 --> 00:31:48,032
NEO:
This can't be.

351
00:31:48,199 --> 00:31:49,242
MORPHEUS:
Be what?

352
00:31:49,951 --> 00:31:51,452
Be real?

353
00:31:55,415 --> 00:31:56,833
- Going into replication.
- Apoc?

354
00:31:57,041 --> 00:31:58,042
Still nothing.

355
00:31:58,626 --> 00:31:59,836
NEO:
It's cold.

356
00:32:00,086 --> 00:32:01,462
It's cold!

357
00:32:05,341 --> 00:32:07,009
Tank, we'll need a signal soon.

358
00:32:08,511 --> 00:32:11,180
- I got a fibrillation.
- Apoc, location.

359
00:32:11,431 --> 00:32:12,890
APOC:
Targeting almost there.

360
00:32:16,185 --> 00:32:17,603
He's going into arrest.

361
00:32:17,854 --> 00:32:20,356
- Lock. I got him!
- Now, Tank, now!

362
00:35:17,617 --> 00:35:18,701
Welcome...

363
00:35:19,035 --> 00:35:20,953
...to the real world.

364
00:35:22,371 --> 00:35:24,206
MORPHEUS:
We've done it, Trinity.

365
00:35:24,457 --> 00:35:26,000
We found him.

366
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:29,045
- I hope you're right.
MORPHEUS: I don't have to hope.

367
00:35:29,629 --> 00:35:31,213
I know it.

368
00:35:36,385 --> 00:35:37,428
Am I dead?

369
00:35:37,928 --> 00:35:40,097
Far from it.

370
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,488
He still needs a lot of work.

371
00:35:57,031 --> 00:35:58,115
What are you doing?

372
00:35:58,366 --> 00:36:00,576
Your muscles atrophied.
We're rebuilding them.

373
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,703
Why do my eyes hurt?

374
00:36:03,412 --> 00:36:05,289
You've never used them before.

375
00:36:09,043 --> 00:36:10,086
Rest, Neo.

376
00:36:10,336 --> 00:36:12,004
The answers are coming.

377
00:37:22,658 --> 00:37:24,243
[DOOR OPENS]

378
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:28,164
Morpheus, what's happened to me?

379
00:37:28,789 --> 00:37:29,874
What is this place?

380
00:37:30,124 --> 00:37:32,793
More important than what is when.

381
00:37:33,294 --> 00:37:34,336
When?

382
00:37:34,545 --> 00:37:36,589
You believe it's the year 1999...

383
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:39,091
...when in fact, it's closer to 2199.

384
00:37:40,217 --> 00:37:42,970
I can't tell you exactly
what year it is...

385
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,847
...because we honestly don't know.

386
00:37:45,347 --> 00:37:48,184
There's nothing I can say
that will explain it for you.

387
00:37:48,434 --> 00:37:51,187
Come with me.
See for yourself.

388
00:37:51,729 --> 00:37:53,481
MORPHEUS:
This is my ship.

389
00:37:53,773 --> 00:37:56,692
The <i>Nebuchadnezzar.</i>
It's a hovercraft.

390
00:37:59,528 --> 00:38:01,280
This is the main deck.

391
00:38:07,036 --> 00:38:08,287
This is the core...

392
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:14,543
...where we broadcast our pirate signal
and hack into the Matrix.

393
00:38:17,922 --> 00:38:21,091
Most of my crew you already know.

394
00:38:26,096 --> 00:38:27,515
This is Apoc...

395
00:38:28,307 --> 00:38:29,642
...Switch...

396
00:38:31,227 --> 00:38:32,394
- ...and Cypher.
- Hi.

397
00:38:32,645 --> 00:38:36,357
The ones you don't know:
Tank and his big brother, Dozer.

398
00:38:37,233 --> 00:38:39,652
The little one behind you is Mouse.

399
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:47,243
You wanted to know
what the Matrix is?

400
00:38:48,285 --> 00:38:49,495
Trinity.

401
00:39:10,516 --> 00:39:12,101
Try to relax.

402
00:39:16,981 --> 00:39:18,816
This will feel a little weird.

403
00:39:30,786 --> 00:39:32,162
This...

404
00:39:32,329 --> 00:39:34,039
...is the Construct.

405
00:39:34,456 --> 00:39:36,584
It's our loading program.

406
00:39:36,834 --> 00:39:39,295
We can load anything, from clothing...

407
00:39:39,545 --> 00:39:40,921
...to equipment...

408
00:39:41,213 --> 00:39:42,548
...weapons...

409
00:39:43,173 --> 00:39:45,009
...training simulations...

410
00:39:45,384 --> 00:39:47,928
...anything we need.

411
00:39:50,723 --> 00:39:53,142
NEO: Right now we're inside
a computer program?

412
00:39:53,434 --> 00:39:55,352
Is it really so hard to believe?

413
00:39:55,853 --> 00:39:58,480
Your clothes are different.
The plugs in your body are gone.

414
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:01,775
Your hair has changed.

415
00:40:02,151 --> 00:40:05,487
Your appearance now is what we call
residual self-image.

416
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:08,824
It is the mental projection
of your digital self.

417
00:40:14,705 --> 00:40:15,831
This isn't real?

418
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:17,625
What is real?

419
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,252
How do you define real?

420
00:40:20,544 --> 00:40:22,463
If you're talking about
what you can feel...

421
00:40:22,713 --> 00:40:25,132
...what you can smell, taste and see...

422
00:40:25,382 --> 00:40:29,261
...then real is simply electrical
signals interpreted by your brain.

423
00:40:33,432 --> 00:40:35,851
This is the world that you know.

424
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:40,314
The world as it was at the end
of the 20th century.

425
00:40:42,691 --> 00:40:47,029
It exists now only as part of
a neural-interactive simulation...

426
00:40:47,279 --> 00:40:48,530
...that we call the Matrix.

427
00:40:53,077 --> 00:40:55,871
You've been living
in a dream world, Neo.

428
00:40:56,872 --> 00:40:57,998
This is the world...

429
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:00,042
...as it exists today.

430
00:41:13,097 --> 00:41:16,058
Welcome to the desert...

431
00:41:16,934 --> 00:41:18,519
...of the real.

432
00:41:21,897 --> 00:41:24,274
We have only bits and pieces
of information.

433
00:41:24,525 --> 00:41:28,320
But what we know for certain
is that in the early 21st century...

434
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:31,824
...all of mankind was united
in celebration.

435
00:41:32,074 --> 00:41:36,829
We marveled at our own magnificence
as we gave birth to AI.

436
00:41:37,621 --> 00:41:38,747
AI.

437
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:41,166
You mean artificial intelligence.

438
00:41:41,417 --> 00:41:45,838
A singular consciousness that spawned
an entire race of machines.

439
00:41:46,672 --> 00:41:50,134
We don't know who struck first,
us or them.

440
00:41:50,551 --> 00:41:53,762
But we know that it was us
that scorched the sky.

441
00:41:55,431 --> 00:41:57,599
They were dependent on solar power...

442
00:41:57,850 --> 00:42:01,186
...and it was believed that
they would be unable to survive...

443
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:05,024
...without an energy source
as abundant as the sun.

444
00:42:05,274 --> 00:42:10,154
Throughout human history, we have
been dependent on machines to survive.

445
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:15,826
Fate, it seems, is not
without a sense of irony.

446
00:42:19,038 --> 00:42:23,459
The human body generates more
bioelectricity than a 120-volt battery.

447
00:42:23,709 --> 00:42:27,838
And over 25,000 BTUs of body heat.

448
00:42:29,757 --> 00:42:31,925
Combined with a form of fusion...

449
00:42:32,259 --> 00:42:37,097
...the machines had found all the energy
they would ever need.

450
00:42:41,143 --> 00:42:44,897
There are fields, Neo,
endless fields...

451
00:42:45,147 --> 00:42:48,400
...where human beings
are no longer born.

452
00:42:49,109 --> 00:42:50,944
We are grown.

453
00:42:56,992 --> 00:42:59,578
For the longest time,
I wouldn't believe it.

454
00:42:59,828 --> 00:43:02,498
And then I saw the fields
with my own eyes...

455
00:43:03,832 --> 00:43:05,459
...watched them liquefy the dead...

456
00:43:05,709 --> 00:43:09,046
...so they could be fed intravenously
to the living.

457
00:43:09,588 --> 00:43:13,842
And standing there,
facing the pure, horrifying precision...

458
00:43:14,093 --> 00:43:17,012
...I came to realize
the obviousness of the truth.

459
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,433
What is the Matrix?

460
00:43:22,643 --> 00:43:23,685
Control.

461
00:43:25,062 --> 00:43:28,440
The Matrix is a computer-generated
dream world...

462
00:43:29,233 --> 00:43:32,319
...built to keep us under control...

463
00:43:33,487 --> 00:43:36,657
...in order to change a human being...

464
00:43:37,282 --> 00:43:38,450
...into this.

465
00:43:39,827 --> 00:43:40,953
No.

466
00:43:42,579 --> 00:43:44,164
I don't believe it.

467
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:45,749
It's not possible.

468
00:43:46,333 --> 00:43:50,921
I didn't say it would be easy, Neo.
I just said it would be the truth.

469
00:43:51,171 --> 00:43:52,464
Stop!

470
00:43:53,006 --> 00:43:54,216
Let me out!

471
00:43:54,925 --> 00:43:56,844
Let me out! I want out!

472
00:43:58,804 --> 00:44:01,473
- Easy, Neo. Easy.
- Get this thing out of me.

473
00:44:01,723 --> 00:44:03,392
Get this thing out of me!

474
00:44:05,185 --> 00:44:06,687
Don't touch me!

475
00:44:06,937 --> 00:44:08,564
Stay away from me!

476
00:44:08,981 --> 00:44:10,482
I don't believe it.

477
00:44:11,191 --> 00:44:12,401
I don't believe it.

478
00:44:12,651 --> 00:44:14,153
I don't believe it.

479
00:44:14,403 --> 00:44:16,446
- He's gonna pop.
- Breathe, Neo.

480
00:44:16,822 --> 00:44:17,906
Just breathe.

481
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,093
I can't go back, can I?

482
00:44:38,927 --> 00:44:40,345
No.

483
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:42,389
But if you could...

484
00:44:43,223 --> 00:44:44,725
...would you really want to?

485
00:44:47,227 --> 00:44:48,604
I owe you an apology.

486
00:44:49,188 --> 00:44:50,564
We have a rule.

487
00:44:51,023 --> 00:44:54,276
We never free a mind
once it's reached a certain age.

488
00:44:54,443 --> 00:44:55,527
It's dangerous.

489
00:44:56,236 --> 00:44:57,946
The mind has trouble letting go.

490
00:44:58,197 --> 00:45:00,490
I've seen it before, and I'm sorry.

491
00:45:01,533 --> 00:45:03,619
I did what I did because...

492
00:45:04,328 --> 00:45:05,787
...I had to.

493
00:45:14,213 --> 00:45:18,300
When the Matrix was first built,
there was a man born inside...

494
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,596
...who had the ability
to change whatever he wanted...

495
00:45:22,971 --> 00:45:25,891
...to remake the Matrix as he saw fit.

496
00:45:27,643 --> 00:45:31,104
It was he who freed the first of us...

497
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:33,607
...taught us the truth.

498
00:45:35,067 --> 00:45:38,153
As long as the Matrix exists...

499
00:45:38,487 --> 00:45:40,572
...the human race will never be free.

500
00:45:44,785 --> 00:45:46,328
After he died...

501
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:49,790
...the Oracle prophesied his return...

502
00:45:50,332 --> 00:45:53,543
...and that his coming would hail
the destruction of the Matrix...

503
00:45:53,794 --> 00:45:55,462
...end the war...

504
00:45:55,796 --> 00:45:57,047
...bring freedom to our people.

505
00:45:58,382 --> 00:46:03,011
That is why there are those of us who
spent our lives searching the Matrix...

506
00:46:03,345 --> 00:46:04,930
...looking for him.

507
00:46:07,349 --> 00:46:09,434
I did what I did because...

508
00:46:11,061 --> 00:46:13,188
...I believe that search is over.

509
00:46:18,277 --> 00:46:19,695
Get some rest.

510
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,114
You're going to need it.

511
00:46:24,825 --> 00:46:25,867
For what?

512
00:46:28,912 --> 00:46:30,122
Your training.

513
00:46:48,432 --> 00:46:50,142
Morning. Did you sleep?

514
00:46:51,018 --> 00:46:52,227
You will tonight.

515
00:46:52,602 --> 00:46:54,146
I guarantee it.

516
00:46:55,647 --> 00:46:57,566
I'm Tank. I'll be your operator.

517
00:46:58,025 --> 00:47:00,444
- You don't have any--
- Holes? Nope.

518
00:47:01,361 --> 00:47:06,074
Me and my brother, Dozer, are 100%
pure, old-fashioned, homegrown human.

519
00:47:06,325 --> 00:47:07,534
Born free right here...

520
00:47:08,076 --> 00:47:09,411
...in the real world.

521
00:47:09,661 --> 00:47:11,330
Genuine child of Zion.

522
00:47:12,164 --> 00:47:14,624
- Zion?
- If the war was over tomorrow...

523
00:47:14,875 --> 00:47:16,376
...Zion's where the party would be.

524
00:47:16,793 --> 00:47:18,086
It's a city?

525
00:47:18,337 --> 00:47:21,506
The last human city.
The only place we have left.

526
00:47:23,091 --> 00:47:24,343
Where is it?

527
00:47:26,094 --> 00:47:29,514
Deep underground near the Earth's core,
where it's still warm.

528
00:47:31,141 --> 00:47:33,018
You live long enough,
you might see it.

529
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:40,108
Goddamn! I gotta tell you, I'm excited
to see what you're capable of...

530
00:47:40,359 --> 00:47:42,110
...if Morpheus is right and all.

531
00:47:42,611 --> 00:47:45,364
We're not supposed to
talk about this, but...

532
00:47:45,614 --> 00:47:47,032
...if you are...

533
00:47:48,116 --> 00:47:50,118
...it's a very exciting time.

534
00:47:51,161 --> 00:47:53,872
We got a lot to do.
We gotta get to it.

535
00:47:57,793 --> 00:48:00,712
We're supposed to start
with these programs first.

536
00:48:01,713 --> 00:48:05,175
That's major boring shit.
Let's do something more fun.

537
00:48:05,509 --> 00:48:06,968
How about...

538
00:48:08,553 --> 00:48:10,305
...combat training?

539
00:48:16,353 --> 00:48:17,813
Jujitsu?

540
00:48:18,688 --> 00:48:20,357
I'm going to learn jujitsu?

541
00:48:31,701 --> 00:48:32,911
Holy shit!

542
00:48:33,161 --> 00:48:35,497
Hey, Mikey, I think he likes it.

543
00:48:35,831 --> 00:48:37,124
How about some more?

544
00:48:37,374 --> 00:48:38,667
Hell, yes.

545
00:48:40,752 --> 00:48:41,795
Hell, yeah.

546
00:48:53,974 --> 00:48:55,058
How is he?

547
00:48:55,308 --> 00:48:57,477
Ten hours straight.
He's a machine.

548
00:49:08,697 --> 00:49:10,073
I know kung fu.

549
00:49:11,741 --> 00:49:12,742
Show me.

550
00:49:14,536 --> 00:49:16,288
This is a sparring program...

551
00:49:16,538 --> 00:49:19,332
...similar to the programmed reality
of the Matrix.

552
00:49:19,583 --> 00:49:21,918
It has the same basic rules.
Like gravity.

553
00:49:22,169 --> 00:49:25,630
These rules are no different
than those of a computer system.

554
00:49:26,173 --> 00:49:27,674
Some of them can be bent.

555
00:49:27,883 --> 00:49:30,343
Others can be broken.

556
00:49:30,886 --> 00:49:31,970
Understand?

557
00:49:33,054 --> 00:49:34,097
Then hit me...

558
00:49:34,681 --> 00:49:35,807
...if you can.

559
00:50:14,804 --> 00:50:15,847
Good!

560
00:50:16,598 --> 00:50:17,766
Adaptation.

561
00:50:18,058 --> 00:50:19,267
Improvisation.

562
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:20,894
But your weakness...

563
00:50:21,144 --> 00:50:22,521
...is not your technique.

564
00:50:29,486 --> 00:50:31,571
Morpheus is fighting Neo.

565
00:51:43,852 --> 00:51:45,020
How did I beat you?

566
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:52,694
You're too fast.

567
00:51:53,236 --> 00:51:54,571
Do you believe that...

568
00:51:54,946 --> 00:51:57,449
...my being stronger or faster...

569
00:51:57,699 --> 00:52:01,369
...has anything to do
with my muscles in this place?

570
00:52:05,415 --> 00:52:07,208
You think you're breathing air?

571
00:52:20,722 --> 00:52:21,931
Again!

572
00:52:33,401 --> 00:52:35,820
Jesus Christ, he's fast!

573
00:52:36,071 --> 00:52:38,281
His neuro-kinetics
are way above normal.

574
00:52:43,745 --> 00:52:45,205
What are you waiting for?

575
00:52:45,455 --> 00:52:47,415
You're faster than this.

576
00:52:49,626 --> 00:52:51,836
Don't think you are.

577
00:52:52,087 --> 00:52:53,755
Know you are.

578
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:06,935
Come on! Stop trying to hit me,
and hit me!

579
00:53:16,861 --> 00:53:18,613
I don't believe it.

580
00:53:20,156 --> 00:53:22,283
I know what you're trying to do.

581
00:53:23,952 --> 00:53:26,121
I'm trying to free your mind, Neo.

582
00:53:26,454 --> 00:53:28,540
But I can only show you the door.

583
00:53:29,124 --> 00:53:30,959
You have to walk through it.

584
00:53:33,336 --> 00:53:35,463
Tank, load the jump program.

585
00:53:47,058 --> 00:53:49,769
You have to let it all go, Neo.
Fear...

586
00:53:50,311 --> 00:53:52,480
...doubt and disbelief.

587
00:53:53,648 --> 00:53:56,359
Free your mind.

588
00:54:04,617 --> 00:54:05,744
Whoa.

589
00:54:12,542 --> 00:54:14,252
Okey-dokey.

590
00:54:16,337 --> 00:54:17,505
Free my mind.

591
00:54:17,964 --> 00:54:19,090
What if he makes it?

592
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:22,051
- No one's ever made their first jump.
MOUSE: I know.

593
00:54:23,386 --> 00:54:25,847
- But what if he does?
- He won't.

594
00:54:26,431 --> 00:54:27,515
Come on.

595
00:54:27,766 --> 00:54:28,933
All right.

596
00:54:29,392 --> 00:54:31,436
No problem. Free my mind.

597
00:54:32,228 --> 00:54:35,023
Free my mind. No problem. Right.

598
00:54:54,417 --> 00:54:56,085
What does that mean?

599
00:54:56,461 --> 00:54:58,296
It doesn't mean anything.

600
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:01,466
Everybody falls the first time.

601
00:55:01,925 --> 00:55:03,218
Right, Trin?

602
00:55:23,905 --> 00:55:26,533
- I thought it wasn't real.
- Your mind makes it real.

603
00:55:29,786 --> 00:55:32,038
If you're killed in the Matrix...

604
00:55:32,205 --> 00:55:33,248
...you die here?

605
00:55:33,873 --> 00:55:36,334
The body cannot live without the mind.

606
00:56:06,823 --> 00:56:10,201
I don't remember you ever
bringing me dinner.

607
00:56:13,288 --> 00:56:16,124
There is something about him,
isn't there?

608
00:56:16,749 --> 00:56:18,376
You're a believer now?

609
00:56:19,377 --> 00:56:20,587
I keep wondering...

610
00:56:20,837 --> 00:56:24,507
...if Morpheus is so sure,
why not take him to see the Oracle?

611
00:56:25,425 --> 00:56:28,344
Morpheus will take him
when he's ready.

612
00:56:38,146 --> 00:56:39,689
The Matrix is a system, Neo.

613
00:56:41,441 --> 00:56:42,734
That system is our enemy.

614
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:45,695
But when you're inside,
what do you see?

615
00:56:45,945 --> 00:56:49,741
Businessmen, teachers,
lawyers, carpenters.

616
00:56:50,199 --> 00:56:52,785
The very minds of the people
we are trying to save.

617
00:56:53,036 --> 00:56:55,997
But until we do, these people are
a part of that system...

618
00:56:56,247 --> 00:56:58,166
...and that makes them our enemy.

619
00:56:58,333 --> 00:56:59,542
You have to understand...

620
00:56:59,792 --> 00:57:03,129
...most of these people are not
ready to be unplugged.

621
00:57:03,379 --> 00:57:04,964
And many of them are so inert...

622
00:57:05,214 --> 00:57:07,634
...so hopelessly dependent
on the system...

623
00:57:07,884 --> 00:57:10,595
...that they will fight to protect it.

624
00:57:12,096 --> 00:57:15,850
Were you listening to me or looking
at the woman in the red dress?

625
00:57:16,017 --> 00:57:17,769
- I was--
- Look again.

626
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:20,104
Freeze it.

627
00:57:26,736 --> 00:57:28,363
NEO: This isn't the Matrix?
MORPHEUS: No.

628
00:57:30,156 --> 00:57:33,993
It's another training program
designed to teach you one thing:

629
00:57:34,619 --> 00:57:37,038
If you are not one of us,
you are one of them.

630
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:40,375
- What are they?
- Sentient programs.

631
00:57:41,125 --> 00:57:45,421
They can move in and out of any
software still hardwired to their system.

632
00:57:45,797 --> 00:57:49,175
That means that anyone
we haven't unplugged...

633
00:57:49,509 --> 00:57:50,843
...is potentially an agent.

634
00:57:51,803 --> 00:57:53,638
Inside the Matrix...

635
00:57:54,222 --> 00:57:55,932
...they are everyone...

636
00:57:56,265 --> 00:57:57,976
...and they are no one.

637
00:57:58,226 --> 00:58:01,354
We have survived by hiding
and running from them...

638
00:58:01,604 --> 00:58:03,231
...but they are the gatekeepers.

639
00:58:03,481 --> 00:58:06,442
They're guarding all the doors
and holding all the keys.

640
00:58:06,693 --> 00:58:09,529
Sooner or later, someone will
have to fight them.

641
00:58:09,696 --> 00:58:10,905
Someone?

642
00:58:11,239 --> 00:58:12,657
MORPHEUS:
I won't lie to you, Neo.

643
00:58:13,116 --> 00:58:17,954
Every single man or woman who
has fought an agent, has died.

644
00:58:18,204 --> 00:58:20,581
But where they have failed,
you will succeed.

645
00:58:20,748 --> 00:58:21,833
Why?

646
00:58:22,083 --> 00:58:24,377
MORPHEUS: I've seen an agent punch
through a concrete wall.

647
00:58:24,627 --> 00:58:28,214
Men have emptied entire clips at them
and hit nothing but air.

648
00:58:28,464 --> 00:58:33,094
Yet their strength and speed are still
based in a world built on rules.

649
00:58:33,344 --> 00:58:34,470
Because of that...

650
00:58:34,721 --> 00:58:38,099
...they will never be as strong
or as fast as you can be.

651
00:58:42,395 --> 00:58:44,272
What are you telling me?

652
00:58:44,981 --> 00:58:46,441
That I can dodge bullets?

653
00:58:48,443 --> 00:58:49,819
No, Neo.

654
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:53,239
I'm trying to tell you
that when you're ready...

655
00:58:54,115 --> 00:58:55,450
...you won't have to.

656
00:58:56,784 --> 00:58:58,286
[PHONE RINGS]

657
00:58:59,579 --> 00:59:00,788
TANK:
<i>We got trouble.</i>

658
00:59:19,724 --> 00:59:22,185
- Did Zion send the warning?
- No, another ship.

659
00:59:25,438 --> 00:59:26,731
Shit.

660
00:59:26,981 --> 00:59:29,859
- Squiddy's sweeping in quick.
- Squiddy?

661
00:59:30,068 --> 00:59:33,279
A sentinel. A killing machine
designed for one thing.

662
00:59:33,529 --> 00:59:34,739
Search and destroy.

663
00:59:36,074 --> 00:59:37,241

00:59:58,513 --> 01:00:00,014
How are we doing, Tank?

665
01:00:08,731 --> 01:00:09,899
Power off-line.

666
01:00:10,399 --> 01:00:12,360
EMP armed...

667
01:00:12,902 --> 01:00:14,445
- ...and ready.
- EMP?

668
01:00:14,737 --> 01:00:16,614
Electromagnetic pulse.

669
01:00:16,864 --> 01:00:19,742
Disables any electrical system
in the blast radius.

670
01:00:19,909 --> 01:00:22,203
It's the only weapon we have
against the machines.

671
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,129
NEO: Where are we?
- Their old service and waste systems.

672
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:33,506
Sewers.

673
01:00:33,714 --> 01:00:36,425
TRINITY: There used to be cities
that spanned hundreds of miles.

674
01:00:36,926 --> 01:00:38,845
Now these sewers are
all that's left.

675
01:00:39,095 --> 01:00:40,429
Quiet.

676
01:01:21,012 --> 01:01:22,471
Whoa! Neo.

677
01:01:24,307 --> 01:01:26,475
You scared the bejesus out of me.

678
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:29,478
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

679
01:01:31,981 --> 01:01:33,232
Is that...?

680
01:01:33,482 --> 01:01:35,067
The Matrix?

681
01:01:35,234 --> 01:01:36,444
Yeah.

682
01:01:38,237 --> 01:01:41,407
- Do you always look at it encoded?
- Well, you have to.

683
01:01:41,657 --> 01:01:44,744
The image translators work
for the construct program.

684
01:01:44,994 --> 01:01:48,414
But there's way too much information
to decode the Matrix.

685
01:01:48,664 --> 01:01:51,626
You get used to it.
I don't even see the code.

686
01:01:51,876 --> 01:01:55,296
All I see is blonde, brunette, redhead.

687
01:01:56,464 --> 01:01:57,840
Do you...

688
01:01:58,132 --> 01:01:59,217
...want a drink?

689
01:01:59,467 --> 01:02:00,509
Sure.

690
01:02:04,055 --> 01:02:05,514
You know...

691
01:02:06,432 --> 01:02:07,975
...I know what you're thinking.

692
01:02:08,226 --> 01:02:10,311
Because right now I'm thinking
the same thing.

693
01:02:10,645 --> 01:02:13,981
Actually, I've been thinking it
ever since I got here.

694
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:18,903
Why, oh, why didn't I take
the blue pill?

695
01:02:29,455 --> 01:02:30,706
[COUGHS]

696
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:33,209
Good shit, huh?

697
01:02:33,542 --> 01:02:34,752
Dozer makes it.

698
01:02:35,211 --> 01:02:36,379
It's good for two things:

699
01:02:36,629 --> 01:02:39,715
Degreasing engines and
killing brain cells.

700
01:02:40,716 --> 01:02:42,927
So can I ask you something?

701
01:02:45,930 --> 01:02:47,556
Did he tell you why he did it?

702
01:02:50,184 --> 01:02:52,019
Why you're here?

703
01:02:55,690 --> 01:02:57,441
Jesus!

704
01:02:58,651 --> 01:03:00,569
What a mind job.

705
01:03:01,988 --> 01:03:04,782
So you're here to save the world.

706
01:03:06,284 --> 01:03:08,369
What do you say
to something like that?

707
01:03:13,541 --> 01:03:14,917
A little piece of advice.

708
01:03:16,711 --> 01:03:18,129
You see an agent...

709
01:03:18,462 --> 01:03:20,756
...you do what we do:

710
01:03:21,090 --> 01:03:22,633
Run.

711
01:03:22,967 --> 01:03:24,719
You run your ass off.

712
01:03:31,976 --> 01:03:33,686
Thanks for the drink.

713
01:03:38,399 --> 01:03:39,567
Sweet dreams.

714
01:03:43,571 --> 01:03:46,991
SMITH:
Do we have a deal, Mr. Reagan?

715
01:03:47,658 --> 01:03:48,784
You know...

716
01:03:50,202 --> 01:03:52,663
...I know this steak doesn't exist.

717
01:03:53,664 --> 01:03:56,417
I know that when I put it
in my mouth...

718
01:03:56,667 --> 01:03:59,754
...the Matrix is telling my brain
that it is...

719
01:04:00,046 --> 01:04:01,172
...juicy...

720
01:04:01,464 --> 01:04:03,174
...and delicious.

721
01:04:06,093 --> 01:04:07,345
After nine years...

722
01:04:08,387 --> 01:04:09,930
...you know what I realize?

723
01:04:17,772 --> 01:04:18,981
Ignorance is bliss.

724
01:04:24,028 --> 01:04:25,863
Then we have a deal.

725
01:04:28,366 --> 01:04:30,284
I don't want to remember nothing.

726
01:04:30,534 --> 01:04:33,037
Nothing. You understand?

727
01:04:36,916 --> 01:04:38,918
And I want to be rich.

728
01:04:40,252 --> 01:04:42,963
You know, someone important.

729
01:04:44,465 --> 01:04:45,591
Like an actor.

730
01:04:46,801 --> 01:04:49,929
Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan.

731
01:04:52,098 --> 01:04:53,641
Okay.

732
01:04:54,016 --> 01:04:56,435
You get my body
back in a power plant...

733
01:04:56,811 --> 01:04:58,562
...reinsert me into the Matrix...

734
01:04:58,896 --> 01:05:00,314
...I'll get you what you want.

735
01:05:00,564 --> 01:05:02,566
Access codes to the Zion mainframe.

736
01:05:02,817 --> 01:05:04,985
No. I told you, I don't know them.

737
01:05:07,947 --> 01:05:09,949
I can get you the man who does.

738
01:05:10,699 --> 01:05:12,493
Morpheus.

739
01:05:22,586 --> 01:05:26,048
Here you go, buddy.
Breakfast of champions.

740
01:05:27,383 --> 01:05:30,177
Close your eyes, it feels
like you're eating runny eggs.

741
01:05:30,386 --> 01:05:32,096
Or a bowl of snot.

742
01:05:32,638 --> 01:05:34,223
MOUSE:
You know what it reminds me of?

743
01:05:36,058 --> 01:05:38,394
Tastee Wheat. Did you
ever eat Tastee Wheat?

744
01:05:39,019 --> 01:05:40,729
No, but technically,
neither did you.

745
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:43,023
That's exactly my point. Exactly.

746
01:05:43,274 --> 01:05:44,650
Because you have to wonder...

747
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:48,154
...how do the machines really know
what Tastee Wheat tasted like?

748
01:05:48,404 --> 01:05:49,822
Maybe they got it wrong.

749
01:05:50,072 --> 01:05:53,284
Maybe what I think Tastee Wheat
tasted like, actually tasted like...

750
01:05:53,576 --> 01:05:55,578
...oatmeal or tuna fish.

751
01:05:55,953 --> 01:05:58,789
That makes you wonder.
Take chicken, for example.

752
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:01,041
Maybe they didn't know
what to make it taste like...

753
01:06:01,292 --> 01:06:03,335
...which is why it tastes
like everything.

754
01:06:03,586 --> 01:06:05,379
- And maybe they--
- Shut up.

755
01:06:07,006 --> 01:06:08,466
DOZER:
It's a single-celled protein...

756
01:06:08,716 --> 01:06:11,760
...combined with synthetic aminos,
vitamins and minerals.

757
01:06:12,011 --> 01:06:13,262
Everything the body needs.

758
01:06:13,512 --> 01:06:16,390
It doesn't have everything
the body needs.

759
01:06:19,143 --> 01:06:22,229
I understand you've run through
the agent training program.

760
01:06:23,272 --> 01:06:25,316
You know, I wrote that program.

761
01:06:25,608 --> 01:06:26,901
Here it comes.

762
01:06:27,151 --> 01:06:29,111
MOUSE: What did you think of her?
NEO: Of who?

763
01:06:29,487 --> 01:06:32,531
The woman in the red dress.
I designed her.

764
01:06:32,865 --> 01:06:35,618
She doesn't talk very much...

765
01:06:35,868 --> 01:06:39,830
...but if you'd like to meet her,
I can arrange a more personal milieu.

766
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:41,457
The digital pimp hard at work.

767
01:06:41,707 --> 01:06:43,959
Pay no attention to
these hypocrites, Neo.

768
01:06:45,252 --> 01:06:47,087
To deny our own impulses...

769
01:06:47,338 --> 01:06:50,466
...is to deny the very thing
that makes us human.

770
01:06:52,384 --> 01:06:53,761
Dozer, when you're done...

771
01:06:53,969 --> 01:06:55,554
...bring the ship up to broadcast depth.

772
01:06:56,138 --> 01:06:57,473
We're going in.

773
01:06:58,182 --> 01:06:59,600
I'm taking Neo to see her.

774
01:07:03,521 --> 01:07:04,772
See who?

775
01:07:05,773 --> 01:07:07,024
The Oracle.

776
01:07:12,530 --> 01:07:14,073
Everyone please observe...

777
01:07:14,406 --> 01:07:17,117
...the fasten seat belt
and no smoking signs are on.

778
01:07:17,618 --> 01:07:20,996

786
01:08:27,688 --> 01:08:29,064
I used to eat there.

Really good noodles.

788
01:08:37,740 --> 01:08:40,242
I have these memories from my life.

789
01:08:42,703 --> 01:08:44,371
None of them happened.

790
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:46,332
What does that mean?

791
01:08:46,582 --> 01:08:48,792
That the Matrix cannot tell you
who you are.

792
01:08:49,710 --> 01:08:50,919
But an oracle can?

793
01:08:51,378 --> 01:08:52,588
That's different.

794
01:08:57,301 --> 01:08:58,552

that made...

...the prophecy?

803
01:09:41,970 --> 01:09:46,308
Yes. She's very old. She's been
with us since the beginning.

804

NEO: The beginning?
- Of the Resistance.

805
01:09:51,021 --> 01:09:53,399
And she knows what? Everything?

806
01:09:55,442 --> 01:09:57,361
She would say she knows enough.

807
01:09:58,487 --> 01:10:00,280
And she's never wrong.

808
01:10:02,491 --> 01:10:05,661
MORPHEUS: Try not to think of it
in terms of right and wrong.

809
01:10:05,994 --> 01:10:07,579
She is a guide, Neo.

810
01:10:07,955 --> 01:10:09,832
She can help you to find the path.

811
01:10:10,332 --> 01:10:11,583
She helped you?

812
01:10:12,292 --> 01:10:13,335
Yes.

813
01:10:14,086 --> 01:10:15,421
What did she tell you?

814
01:10:17,881 --> 01:10:20,092
That I would find the One.

815
01:10:33,230 --> 01:10:35,357
I told you I can only
show you the door.

01:10:36,066 --> 01:10:38,152

01:10:41,947 --> 01:10:43,031
Hello, Neo.

Instead, only try
to realize the truth.

01:11:56,980 --> 01:11:58,357
What truth?

826
01:11:58,607 --> 01:12:00,275
There is no spoon.

There is no spoon?

828
01:12:04,446 --> 01:12:08,909
Then you'll see that it is not the spoon
that bends. It is only yourself.

were expecting, right?

01:28:39,857 --> 01:28:42,360
All I do is what he tells me to do.

1023
01:28:43,945 --> 01:28:46,864
If I had to choose between
that and the Matrix...

1024
01:28:48,032 --> 01:28:49,242
...I choose the Matrix.

1025
01:28:49,492 --> 01:28:51,160
The Matrix isn't real.

1026
01:28:51,410 --> 01:28:52,829
<i>I disagree, Trinity.</i>

1027
01:28:53,079 --> 01:28:55,331
I think the Matrix...

1028
01:28:55,665 --> 01:28:58,251
...can be more real than this world.

1029
01:29:00,419 --> 01:29:02,922
All I do is pull the plug here.

1030
01:29:03,297 --> 01:29:04,507
But there...

1031
01:29:05,049 --> 01:29:07,343
<i>...you have to watch Apoc die.</i>

1032
01:29:08,344 --> 01:29:09,595
Trinity.

1033
01:29:15,101 --> 01:29:18,062
<i>- Welcome to the real world.</i>
- But you're out, Cypher.

1034
01:29:18,312 --> 01:29:20,731
<i>- You can't go back.</i>
- That's what you think.

1035
01:29:20,982 --> 01:29:22,483
<i>They'll reinsert my body.</i>

1036
01:29:22,733 --> 01:29:26,362
<i>I go back to sleep. When I wake up,
I won't remember a thing.</i>

1037
01:29:26,571 --> 01:29:27,613
By the way...

1038
01:29:27,864 --> 01:29:30,825
...if you have anything important
to say to Switch...

1039
01:29:31,325 --> 01:29:32,410
<i>...say it now.</i>

1040
01:29:32,660 --> 01:29:35,705
- No, please don't.
- Not like this.

1041
01:29:37,415 --> 01:29:39,041
Not like this.

1042
01:29:43,504 --> 01:29:44,547
Too late.

1043
01:29:45,298 --> 01:29:46,591
Goddamn you, Cypher!

1044
01:29:46,841 --> 01:29:48,718
Don't hate me, Trinity.

1045
01:29:49,093 --> 01:29:50,970
I'm just a messenger.

1046
01:29:51,387 --> 01:29:54,557
And right now,
I'm going to prove it to you.

1047
01:29:55,641 --> 01:29:57,310
If Morpheus was right...

1048
01:29:57,852 --> 01:29:59,729
...there's no way
I can pull this plug.

1049
01:30:00,313 --> 01:30:01,814
<i>If Neo's the One...</i>

1050
01:30:02,315 --> 01:30:04,150
<i>...then there'd have to be...</i>

1051
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:06,986
...some kind of a miracle to stop me.

1052
01:30:07,153 --> 01:30:08,362
Right?

1053
01:30:08,988 --> 01:30:11,073
I mean, how can he be the One...

1054
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:12,325
...if he's dead?

1055
01:30:13,701 --> 01:30:15,953
<i>You never did answer me before...</i>

1056
01:30:16,245 --> 01:30:18,581
<i>...if you bought into
Morpheus' bullshit.</i>

1057
01:30:18,956 --> 01:30:22,168
Come on. All I want
is a little yes or no.

1058
01:30:23,544 --> 01:30:25,880
Look into his eyes...

1059
01:30:26,631 --> 01:30:28,132
<i>...those big, pretty eyes...</i>

1060
01:30:30,885 --> 01:30:32,219

1061
01:30:32,929 --> 01:30:34,180
<i>...yes...</i>

1062
01:30:34,513 --> 01:30:35,890
<i>...or no.</i>

1063
01:30:37,183 --> 01:30:38,726
- Yes.
<i>- No!</i>

1064
01:30:38,893 --> 01:30:40,061
I don't believe it.

1065
01:30:41,479 --> 01:30:46,233
Believe it or not, you piece of shit,
you're still going to burn!

1066
01:30:53,407 --> 01:30:54,659
[PHONE RINGS]

1067
01:31:04,502 --> 01:31:05,878
You first.

1068
01:31:14,095 --> 01:31:16,389
- You're hurt.
- I'll be all right.

1069
01:31:19,183 --> 01:31:20,351
Dozer?

1070
01:31:38,619 --> 01:31:40,997
SMITH:
Have you ever stood and stared at it?

1071
01:31:41,872 --> 01:31:45,001
Marveled at its beauty...

1072
01:31:45,376 --> 01:31:47,628
...its genius?

1073
01:31:48,796 --> 01:31:50,673
Billions of people...

1074
01:31:50,923 --> 01:31:53,676
...just living out their lives.

1075
01:31:54,719 --> 01:31:56,387
Oblivious.

1076
01:32:00,975 --> 01:32:03,853
Did you know that the first Matrix...

1077
01:32:04,103 --> 01:32:08,774
...was designed to be a perfect
human world where none suffered...

1078
01:32:09,275 --> 01:32:12,194
...where everyone would be happy.

1079
01:32:12,737 --> 01:32:14,238
It was a disaster.

1080
01:32:14,488 --> 01:32:18,826
No one would accept the program.
Entire crops were lost.

1081
01:32:19,702 --> 01:32:21,454
Some believe that...

1082
01:32:21,704 --> 01:32:26,083
...we lacked the programming language
to describe your perfect world.

1083
01:32:26,333 --> 01:32:27,877
But I believe that...

1084
01:32:28,044 --> 01:32:29,211
...as a species...

1085
01:32:29,462 --> 01:32:33,299
...human beings define
their reality through misery...

1086
01:32:33,549 --> 01:32:34,925
...and suffering.

1087
01:32:35,176 --> 01:32:37,887
So the perfect world was a dream...

1088
01:32:38,137 --> 01:32:42,975
...that your primitive cerebrum
kept trying to wake up from.

1089
01:32:44,310 --> 01:32:47,980
Which is why the Matrix was
redesigned to this.

1090
01:32:48,439 --> 01:32:49,940
The peak...

1091
01:32:50,191 --> 01:32:51,609
...of your civilization.

1092
01:32:51,859 --> 01:32:54,111
I say, your civilization...

1093
01:32:54,361 --> 01:32:58,491
...because when we started thinking
for you, it became our civilization...

1094
01:32:58,741 --> 01:33:01,827
...which is, of course,
what this is all about.

1095
01:33:03,162 --> 01:33:05,748
Evolution, Morpheus.

1096
01:33:06,040 --> 01:33:07,374
Evolution.

1097
01:33:09,668 --> 01:33:11,545
Like the dinosaur.

1098
01:33:13,714 --> 01:33:15,341
Look out that window.

1099
01:33:16,050 --> 01:33:18,177
You had your time.

1100
01:33:18,886 --> 01:33:22,807
The future is our world, Morpheus.

1101
01:33:23,140 --> 01:33:25,518
The future is our time.

1102
01:33:29,772 --> 01:33:30,940
There could be a problem.

1103
01:33:31,857 --> 01:33:35,236
NEO: What are they doing to him?
- They're breaking into his mind.

1104
01:33:35,486 --> 01:33:37,655
It's like hacking a computer.
All it takes is time.

1105
01:33:37,905 --> 01:33:39,115
How much time?

1106
01:33:39,365 --> 01:33:42,493
Depends on the mind.
But eventually, it'll crack...

1107
01:33:42,743 --> 01:33:47,164
...and his alpha patterns
will change from this to this.

1108
01:33:47,414 --> 01:33:50,376
When it does, he'll tell them
anything they want to know.

1109
01:33:50,626 --> 01:33:51,669
What do they want?

1110
01:33:51,919 --> 01:33:55,965
The leader of every ship is given
codes to Zion's mainframe computer.

1111
01:33:56,215 --> 01:33:59,135
If an agent got the codes
and got into Zion's mainframe...

1112
01:33:59,385 --> 01:34:02,471
...they could destroy us.
We can't let that happen.

1113
01:34:02,638 --> 01:34:04,890
Trinity, Zion's more important than me...

1114
01:34:05,057 --> 01:34:06,225
...or you...

1115
01:34:06,392 --> 01:34:07,685
...or even Morpheus.

1116
01:34:11,480 --> 01:34:13,149
There has to be
something we can do.

1117
01:34:13,566 --> 01:34:15,568
There is. We pull the plug.

1118
01:34:18,654 --> 01:34:20,406
You're going to kill him?

1119
01:34:20,656 --> 01:34:21,824
Kill Morpheus?

1120
01:34:22,449 --> 01:34:24,076
We don't have a choice.

1121
01:34:30,875 --> 01:34:33,794
Never send a human
to do a machine's job.

1122
01:34:34,044 --> 01:34:35,796
If the insider has failed...

1123
01:34:36,046 --> 01:34:39,258
...they'll sever the connection
as soon as possible, unless--

1124
01:34:39,508 --> 01:34:41,218
They're dead. In either case--

1125
01:34:41,468 --> 01:34:45,014
We have no choice. Continue as planned.
Deploy the sentinels.

1126
01:34:45,264 --> 01:34:46,348
Immediately.

1127
01:34:51,604 --> 01:34:54,273
Morpheus, you were more
than a leader to us.

1128
01:34:55,232 --> 01:34:57,443
You were a father.

1129
01:34:58,986 --> 01:35:00,946
We'll miss you always.

1130
01:35:07,828 --> 01:35:09,038
Stop!

1131
01:35:10,206 --> 01:35:11,540
I don't believe this is happening.

1132
01:35:11,707 --> 01:35:13,751
- Neo, this has to be done.
NEO: Does it?

1133
01:35:14,543 --> 01:35:15,920
I don't know.

1134
01:35:16,253 --> 01:35:18,714
- This can't be just coincidence.
- What?

1135
01:35:18,923 --> 01:35:20,174
NEO:
The Oracle.

1136
01:35:20,424 --> 01:35:22,218
She told me this would happen.

1137
01:35:22,635 --> 01:35:26,805
She told me that I would
have to make a choice.

1138
01:35:27,264 --> 01:35:28,474
What choice?

1139
01:35:31,477 --> 01:35:33,979
- What are you doing?
- I'm going in.

1140
01:35:34,313 --> 01:35:36,649
TRINITY: No, you're not.
- I have to.

1141
01:35:36,857 --> 01:35:40,486
Neo, Morpheus sacrificed himself
so that we could get you out.

1142
01:35:40,736 --> 01:35:42,655
There is no way
that you're going back in.

1143
01:35:43,239 --> 01:35:46,492
Morpheus did what he did because
he believed I'm something I'm not.

1144
01:35:47,993 --> 01:35:49,036
What?

1145
01:35:49,745 --> 01:35:51,372
I'm not the One, Trinity.

1146
01:35:51,747 --> 01:35:54,708
- The Oracle hit me with that too.
- No, you have to be.

1147
01:35:54,959 --> 01:35:57,628
I'm sorry, I'm not.
I'm just another guy.

1148
01:35:58,295 --> 01:35:59,546
No, Neo, that's not true.

1149
01:36:00,130 --> 01:36:02,758
- It can't be true.
- Why?

1150
01:36:07,179 --> 01:36:10,516
This is loco. They've got Morpheus
in a military-controlled building.

1151
01:36:10,766 --> 01:36:15,145
Even if you somehow got inside, those
are agents holding him. Three of them.

1152
01:36:16,438 --> 01:36:20,359
I want Morpheus back too, but
what you're talking about is suicide.

1153
01:36:20,609 --> 01:36:22,194
That's what it looks like...

1154
01:36:22,361 --> 01:36:23,404
...but it's not.

1155
01:36:23,654 --> 01:36:26,031
I can't explain to you why it's not.

1156
01:36:27,116 --> 01:36:30,828
Morpheus believed something, and
he was ready to give his life for it.

1157
01:36:31,078 --> 01:36:34,081
I understand that now.
That's why I have to go.

1158
01:36:34,373 --> 01:36:36,875
- Why?
- Because I believe in something.

1159
01:36:37,042 --> 01:36:38,669
What?

1160
01:36:39,378 --> 01:36:41,088
I believe I can bring him back.

1161
01:36:58,063 --> 01:36:59,982
- What are you doing?
- Going with you.

1162
01:37:00,274 --> 01:37:02,276
- No, you're not.
- No?

1163
01:37:03,444 --> 01:37:05,571
Let me tell you what I believe.

1164
01:37:06,071 --> 01:37:08,449
Morpheus means more to me
than he does to you.

1165
01:37:08,782 --> 01:37:13,078
I believe if you are serious about
saving him, you will need my help.

1166
01:37:13,329 --> 01:37:15,372
And since I am the ranking officer...

1167
01:37:15,622 --> 01:37:18,500
...if you don't like it,
I believe you can go to hell.

1168
01:37:19,251 --> 01:37:21,670
Because you aren't going anywhere else.

1169
01:37:22,087 --> 01:37:23,630
Tank...

1170
01:37:23,797 --> 01:37:24,923
...load us up.

1171
01:37:34,558 --> 01:37:37,853
I'd like to share
a revelation that I've had...

1172
01:37:38,270 --> 01:37:39,813
...during my time here.

1173
01:37:40,064 --> 01:37:44,068
It came to me when I tried
to classify your species...

1174
01:37:44,318 --> 01:37:46,570
...and I realized...

1175
01:37:46,820 --> 01:37:49,114
...that you're not actually mammals.

1176
01:37:51,325 --> 01:37:53,786
Every mammal on this planet...

1177
01:37:54,119 --> 01:37:59,041
...instinctively develops an equilibrium
with the surrounding environment.

1178
01:37:59,291 --> 01:38:01,126
But you humans do not.

1179
01:38:01,668 --> 01:38:05,214
You move to an area
and you multiply...

1180
01:38:05,464 --> 01:38:09,968
...and multiply until every
natural resource is consumed.

1181
01:38:10,302 --> 01:38:12,388
The only way you can survive...

1182
01:38:12,679 --> 01:38:15,641
...is to spread to another area.

1183
01:38:21,063 --> 01:38:23,941
There is another organism
on this planet...

1184
01:38:24,191 --> 01:38:26,151
...that follows the same pattern.

1185
01:38:26,777 --> 01:38:28,445
Do you know what it is?

1186
01:38:28,821 --> 01:38:30,656
A virus.

1187
01:38:31,990 --> 01:38:35,035
Human beings are a disease.

1188
01:38:35,411 --> 01:38:36,954
A cancer of this planet.

1189
01:38:37,204 --> 01:38:39,331
You are a plague.

1190
01:38:39,873 --> 01:38:41,291
And we...

1191
01:38:41,458 --> 01:38:42,835
...are the cure.

1192
01:38:43,836 --> 01:38:45,254
Okay, so what do you need?

1193

I like to be reminded this city survives

Yeah, I suppose we do, but...

And when I look at these machines...

356
00:36:17,051 --> 00:36:22,139
...I can't help thinking that, in a way,
we are plugged into them.

- They have their reasons...

492
00:47:37,647 --> 00:47:41,610
...but usually a program chooses exile
when it faces deletion.

493
00:47:42,027 --> 00:47:45,947
- And why would a program be deleted?
- Maybe it breaks down.

494

Maybe a better program is created
to replace it. Happens all the time.

01:05:28,050 --> 01:05:31,011
But this is not a reason,
this is not a why.

675
01:05:31,178 --> 01:05:34,932
The Keymaker himself, his very nature,
is a means, it is not an end.

676
01:05:35,099 --> 01:05:40,855
And so to look for him is to be
looking for a means to do...

677
01:05:41,021 --> 01:05:44,191
- ...what?
- You know the answer to that question.

678

But do you?

679
01:05:46,694 --> 01:05:49,029
You think you do, but you do not.

680
01:05:49,196 --> 01:05:52,408
You are here
because you were sent here.

681
01:05:52,575 --> 01:05:55,703
You were told to come here,
and then you obeyed.

682
01:05:56,871 --> 01:05:59,206
It is, of course, the way of all things.

683
01:05:59,373 --> 01:06:02,042
You see, there is only one constant...

684
01:06:02,209 --> 01:06:06,380
...one universal. It is the only real truth.

- Cause and effect.
- Everything begins with choice.

No. Wrong.

689
01:06:17,141 --> 01:06:21,729
Choice is an illusion created
between those with power...

But wait.

a new effect, just like...

You can see it, Neo, yes?

704
01:07:18,536 --> 01:07:21,121
She does not understand why.

705
01:07:21,372 --> 01:07:23,791
Is it the wine? No.

706
01:07:23,958 --> 01:07:26,335
What is it then? What is the reason?

707
01:07:26,961 --> 01:07:29,296
And soon it does not matter.

708
01:07:29,463 --> 01:07:32,466
Soon the why and the reason are gone...

709
01:07:33,425 --> 01:07:38,973
...and all that matters is the feeling itself.

710
01:07:39,431 --> 01:07:42,518
And this is the nature of the universe.

711
01:07:42,685 --> 01:07:45,229
We struggle against it,
we fight to deny it...

712
01:07:45,396 --> 01:07:47,982
...but it is, of course, pretense.
It is a lie.

Beneath our poised appearance...

714

...out of control.

716
01:08:08,711 --> 01:08:13,591
Causality. There is no escape from it.
We are forever slaves to it.

717
01:08:14,008 --> 01:08:19,471
Our only hope, our only peace,
is to understand it, to understand the why.

You will know which door.
Hurry, Neo.

1034
01:49:33,985 --> 01:49:37,155
Trinity, I got some serious activity
headed your way.

1035
01:50:29,457 --> 01:50:30,834
Hello, Neo.

1036
01:50:31,376 --> 01:50:35,171
- Who are you?
- I am the Architect.

1037
01:50:35,338 --> 01:50:38,967
I created the Matrix.
I've been waiting for you.

1038
01:50:39,217 --> 01:50:43,388
You have many questions. Though the
process has altered your consciousness...

1039
01:50:43,555 --> 01:50:45,557
...you remain irrevocably human.

1040
01:50:45,723 --> 01:50:49,310
Ergo, some of my answers you will
understand and some you will not.

1041
01:50:49,727 --> 01:50:53,773
Concordantly, while your first question
may be the most pertinent...

1042
01:50:53,940 --> 01:50:57,652
...you may or may not realize
it is also the most irrelevant.

1043
01:50:58,528 --> 01:51:00,155
Why am I here?

1044
01:51:00,321 --> 01:51:04,242
Your life is the sum of a remainder
of an unbalanced equation...

1045
01:51:04,409 --> 01:51:06,744
...inherent to the programming
of the Matrix.

1046
01:51:06,911 --> 01:51:10,999
You are the eventuality of an anomaly,
which despite my sincerest efforts...

1047
01:51:11,166 --> 01:51:14,002
...I've been unable to eliminate
from what is otherwise...

1048
01:51:14,169 --> 01:51:18,631
...a harmony of mathematical precision.

1049
01:51:18,965 --> 01:51:21,301
While it remains a burden
assiduously avoided...

1050
01:51:21,467 --> 01:51:25,930
...it is not unexpected and thus
not beyond a measure of control...

1051
01:51:26,097 --> 01:51:30,059
...which has led you, inexorably...

1052
01:51:31,019 --> 01:51:32,270
...here.

1053
01:51:32,437 --> 01:51:36,524
- You haven't answered my question.
- Quite right.

1054
01:51:36,691 --> 01:51:40,486
Interesting.
That was quicker than the others.

1055
01:51:40,653 --> 01:51:43,281
NEOS: <i>Others? How many?
What others?</i>

1056
01:51:43,448 --> 01:51:45,950
The Matrix is older than you know.

1057
01:51:46,117 --> 01:51:50,121
I count from the emergence of one integral
anomaly to the emergence of the next.

1058
01:51:50,288 --> 01:51:52,540
In which case, this is the sixth version.

1059
01:51:52,707 --> 01:51:55,168
NEOS: <i>Five before me?
He's lying. Bullshit.</i>

1060
01:51:55,335 --> 01:51:58,880
<i>There are only two possible explanations.
There were five before me.</i>

1061
01:51:59,047 --> 01:52:00,340
<i>Either no one told me...</i>

1062
01:52:01,591 --> 01:52:05,595
- ...or no one knows.
- Precisely.

1063
01:52:05,762 --> 01:52:09,057
As you are undoubtedly gathering,
the anomaly is systemic...

1064
01:52:09,224 --> 01:52:12,644
...creating fluctuations in even
the most simplistic equations.

1065
01:52:12,810 --> 01:52:16,064
<i>You can't control me!
I'm gonna smash you to bits!</i>

1066
01:52:16,231 --> 01:52:18,024
<i>I'm gonna fucking kill you!</i>

1067
01:52:18,191 --> 01:52:21,361
<i>You can't make me do anything.
You old, white prick!</i>

1068
01:52:23,655 --> 01:52:25,156
Choice.

1069
01:52:25,323 --> 01:52:27,158
The problem is choice.

1070
01:52:27,700 --> 01:52:28,743
[ELEVATOR BELL RINGS]

1071
01:52:49,389 --> 01:52:53,017
The first Matrix I designed
was naturally perfect, a work of art.

1072
01:52:53,184 --> 01:52:55,019
Flawless, sublime.

1073
01:52:55,186 --> 01:52:58,690
A triumph equaled only
by its monumental failure.

1074
01:52:59,357 --> 01:53:01,776
The inevitability of its doom
is apparent now...

1075
01:53:01,943 --> 01:53:05,280
...as a consequence of the imperfection
inherent in every human.

1076
01:53:05,446 --> 01:53:08,408
Thus, I redesigned it
based on your history...

1077
01:53:08,574 --> 01:53:12,578
...to more accurately reflect
the varying grotesqueries of your nature.

1078
01:53:13,288 --> 01:53:17,041
However, I was again frustrated
by failure.

1079
01:53:18,501 --> 01:53:21,129
I have come to understand
that the answer eluded me...

1080
01:53:21,296 --> 01:53:23,339
...because it required a lesser mind.

1081
01:53:23,506 --> 01:53:29,470
Or perhaps, a mind less bound
by the parameters of perfection.

1082
01:53:29,887 --> 01:53:34,309
Thus, the answer was stumbled upon
by another, an intuitive program...

1083
01:53:34,475 --> 01:53:39,272
...initially created to investigate
certain aspects of the human psyche.

1084
01:53:39,439 --> 01:53:45,403
If I am the father of the Matrix,
she would undoubtedly be its mother.

1085
01:53:46,029 --> 01:53:48,323
- The Oracle.
- Please.

1086
01:53:49,032 --> 01:53:53,036
As I was saying, she stumbled upon a
solution whereby 99 percent of subjects...

1087
01:53:53,202 --> 01:53:56,080
...accepted the program, as long as they
were given a choice...

1088
01:53:56,247 --> 01:54:00,376
...even if they were only aware
of the choice at a near unconscious level.

1089
01:54:00,543 --> 01:54:03,963
While this answer functioned,
it was fundamentally flawed...

1090
01:54:04,130 --> 01:54:08,134
...thus creating the otherwise
contradictory systemic anomaly...

1091
01:54:08,301 --> 01:54:11,012
...that, if left unchecked,
might threaten the system.

1092
01:54:11,387 --> 01:54:15,516
Ergo, those that refused the program,
while a minority, if unchecked...

1093
01:54:15,683 --> 01:54:19,771
...would constitute
an escalating probability of disaster.

1094
01:54:19,937 --> 01:54:21,731
This is about Zion.

1095
01:54:22,190 --> 01:54:25,860
You are here because Zion
is about to be destroyed.

1096
01:54:26,027 --> 01:54:30,448
Its every living inhabitant terminated,
its entire existence eradicated.

1097
01:54:30,740 --> 01:54:31,783
Bullshit.

1098
01:54:31,949 --> 01:54:35,119
Denial is the most predictable
of all human responses.

1099
01:54:35,328 --> 01:54:41,793
But rest assured, this will be
the sixth time we have destroyed it...

1100
01:54:41,959 --> 01:54:45,963
...and we have become
exceedingly efficient at it.

1101
01:54:58,684 --> 01:54:59,977
The function of the One...

1102
01:55:00,144 --> 01:55:04,816
...is now to return to the source, allowing
a dissemination of the code you carry...

1103
01:55:04,982 --> 01:55:06,692
...reinserting the prime program.

1104
01:55:07,276 --> 01:55:11,280
After which you will be required to select
from the Matrix 23 individuals...

1105
01:55:11,447 --> 01:55:14,700
...sixteen female, seven male,
to rebuild Zion.

1106
01:55:14,867 --> 01:55:19,414
Failure to comply with this process
will result in a cataclysmic system crash...

1107
01:55:19,580 --> 01:55:21,916
...killing everyone connected
to the Matrix...

1108
01:55:22,083 --> 01:55:24,669
...which, coupled with the
extermination of Zion...

1109
01:55:24,836 --> 01:55:29,048
...will result in the extinction
of the entire human race.

1110
01:55:29,382 --> 01:55:33,469
You won't let it happen. You can't.
You need human beings to survive.

1111
01:55:34,262 --> 01:55:37,890
There are levels of survival
we are prepared to accept.

1112
01:55:38,057 --> 01:55:40,852
The relevant issue is
whether or not you are ready...

1113
01:55:41,018 --> 01:55:44,605
...to accept the responsibility for the death
of every human being in this world.

1114
01:55:51,070 --> 01:55:53,614
It is interesting reading your reactions.

1115
01:55:54,657 --> 01:55:58,494
Your five predecessors were, by design,
based on a similar predication...

1116
01:55:58,661 --> 01:56:03,124
...a contingent affirmation that was meant
to create a profound attachment...

1117
01:56:03,291 --> 01:56:06,878
...to the rest of your species,
facilitating the function of the One.

1118
01:56:07,044 --> 01:56:09,380
While the others experience this
in a general way...

1119
01:56:09,547 --> 01:56:12,508
...your experience is far more specific...

1120
01:56:12,842 --> 01:56:15,720

No.

1124
01:56:27,106 --> 01:56:31,235
Which brings us at last to the moment
of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw...

1125
01:56:31,402 --> 01:56:34,489
...is ultimately expressed
and the anomaly revealed...

1126
01:56:34,655 --> 01:56:38,659
...as both beginning and end.

The door to your right leads to the source

He guessed that the machines...

...would cut off the mainlines

- ...but it wasn't meant to be.
- What happened?

61
00:05:40,508 --> 00:05:45,096
I made a choice, and that choice
cost me more than I wanted it to.

62
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:46,639
What choice?

63
00:05:47,098 --> 00:05:49,934
To help you, to guide Neo.

64
00:05:50,101 --> 00:05:55,022
Now, since the real test for any choice is
having to make the same choice again...

65
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:59,026
...knowing full well
what it might cost...

66
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:01,779
...I guess I feel pretty good
about that choice...

67
00:06:01,946 --> 00:06:06,242
...because here I am, at it again.

68
00:06:06,492 --> 00:06:10,288
- Do you know what happened to Neo?
- Yes.

69
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:15,167
He is trapped in a place between
this world and the machine world.

70
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:19,672
The link is controlled by a program
called the Trainman.

71
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:24,385
He uses it to smuggle programs
in and out of the Matrix.

72
00:06:24,552 --> 00:06:27,722
If he finds out where Neo is
before you get to him...

73
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:31,350
...then I'm afraid our choices
are going to become difficult.

74
00:06:31,517 --> 00:06:34,687
- Why?
- Because of who the Trainman works for.

NEO: You helped me to get here,
but my question is, why?

299

Where is this going?

300

- I don't know.

301

- You don't know or you won't tell me?
ORACLE: I told you before...

302
00:26:22,749 --> 00:26:27,754
...no one can see beyond a choice they
don't understand, and I mean no one.

303
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:32,258
- What choice?
- It doesn't matter. It's my choice.

304
00:26:32,425 --> 00:26:34,928
I have mine to make,
same as you have yours.

305
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:38,098
Does that include what things
to tell me and what not to?

306
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:39,516
Of course not.

307
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:41,893
Then why didn't you tell me
about the Architect?

308
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:46,272
About Zion and the ones before me?
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

309
00:26:47,232 --> 00:26:51,111
- Because it wasn't time for you to know.
- Who decided it wasn't time?

You know who.

311

312

Then I think it's time for me to know
a few more things.

So do I.

from my body without jacking in.

by thinking it.

is happening to me.

The power of the One
extends beyond this world.

318
00:27:25,979 --> 00:27:29,524
It reaches from here all the way back
to where it came from.

319
00:27:29,691 --> 00:27:31,943
- Where?
- The source.

320

That's what you felt when you touched
those sentinels, but you weren't ready.

You should be dead, but apparently
you weren't ready for that either.

322
00:27:44,831 --> 00:27:47,667
The Architect told me that
if I didn't return to the source...

323
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:49,669
...Zion would be destroyed tonight.

324
00:27:49,836 --> 00:27:54,174
Please. You and I may not be able
to see beyond our own choices...

325
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:57,093
...but that man can't see
past any choice.

326

- Why not?
- He doesn't understand them. He can't.

327
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:04,184
To him, they are variables
in an equation.

328
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:08,396
One at a time, each variable
must be solved, then countered.

329
00:28:08,563 --> 00:28:12,275
That's his purpose.
To balance the equation.

330
00:28:12,692 --> 00:28:14,819
What's your purpose?

331
00:28:14,986 --> 00:28:17,030

as far as you are to get it.

to that question, but....

one place you're going to find it.

no tomorrow for any of us.

He can't.

00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:23,088
- Half the infantry?
- If it were up to me, councillor...

461
00:40:23,255 --> 00:40:26,550
...I'd take every man, woman and child,
put a gun in their hand...

462
00:40:26,717 --> 00:40:28,594
...and march them into that dock.

463
00:40:28,761 --> 00:40:31,513
Perhaps it is best
that it is not up to you.

464
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,682
Time will tell, councillor.

465
00:40:33,933 --> 00:40:36,602
Commander, just one more question.

466
00:40:36,769 --> 00:40:39,063
Has there been word
from the <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>?

467
00:40:39,229 --> 00:40:42,691
None, and at this point there's no reason
to expect there will be.

468
00:40:42,858 --> 00:40:44,860
Perhaps.

469
00:40:45,027 --> 00:40:46,445
But we can hope.

470
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:50,032
I'm afraid hope is an indulgence
I don't have time for.

471
00:41:01,919 --> 00:41:04,880
- Zee, what are you doing?
- Making shells.

472
00:41:05,047 --> 00:41:07,716
They're evacuating our level.
We have to go.

473
00:41:07,883 --> 00:41:10,219
- I'm not going with you.
- What?

474
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:13,889
They've called for volunteers
to hold the dock.

475
00:41:17,726 --> 00:41:19,979
Kids, you stay here.

476
00:41:21,897 --> 00:41:24,316
I know how you feel,
but you can't do this.

477
00:41:24,483 --> 00:41:26,485
- I have to.
CAS: Why?

478
00:41:26,652 --> 00:41:28,821
Because I love him.

479
00:41:29,488 --> 00:41:31,865
I love him the same as he loves me.

480
00:41:32,032 --> 00:41:35,369
And if I were out there and he
were here, I know what he'd do.

481
00:41:36,245 --> 00:41:39,832
But you're gonna get yourself killed.
It's crazy, Zee.

482
00:41:41,625 --> 00:41:45,170
Maybe it is. But ask yourself,
if it were Dozer...

483
00:41:45,337 --> 00:41:49,216
...and you knew the only chance you had
to see him was to hold the dock...

484
00:41:49,383 --> 00:41:51,510
...what would you do?

485
00:41:56,515 --> 00:41:58,559
Make shells.

486
00:42:09,319 --> 00:42:12,197
What the shit is going on over here?

487
00:42:12,364 --> 00:42:15,909
An accident, sir. I didn't see--

488
00:42:16,076 --> 00:42:18,203
- I'm sorry.
- Who the hell are you?

489
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:20,664
A unit volunteer, sir.

490
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:25,044
What's a pod-born pencil-neck like you
doing volunteering for my Corps?

491
00:42:25,711 --> 00:42:29,214
I want to do my part, sir.
We gotta hold the dock.

492
00:42:30,549 --> 00:42:32,676
- How old are you, kid?
- Eighteen.

493
00:42:32,843 --> 00:42:35,971
Should have said 16,
I might have believed that.

494
00:42:36,221 --> 00:42:37,556
Okay, I'm 16.

495
00:42:37,723 --> 00:42:41,310
Minimum age for the Corps is 18.
Sixteen's too young.

496
00:42:41,477 --> 00:42:46,315
The machines don't care how old I am.
They'll kill me just the same.

497
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,817
Ain't that the goddamn truth.

498
00:42:49,318 --> 00:42:52,613
Give me a chance, sir.
I won't let you down.

499
00:42:53,322 --> 00:42:54,698
You do...

500
00:42:54,907 --> 00:42:58,494
...and you'll find me and the machines
have got something in common.

501
00:43:11,423 --> 00:43:14,093
Okay, charge the igniter.

502
00:43:20,265 --> 00:43:22,142
She lives again.

503
00:43:22,476 --> 00:43:25,604
Want us to patch an uplink to reload
the operations software, Sparky?

504
00:43:25,771 --> 00:43:29,108
That'd be swell. Could you clean
the windshield while you're at it?

505
00:43:33,946 --> 00:43:36,532
SPARKS: Uplinks in place.
I'm bringing her back online.

506
00:43:36,698 --> 00:43:39,451
Looking good, except, uh....

507
00:43:41,286 --> 00:43:43,330
Something's wrong
with the Matrix feed.

508
00:43:43,497 --> 00:43:46,708
No, there's not. You're looking
at what we're looking at.

509
00:43:46,875 --> 00:43:50,379
SPARKS: <i>What's going on in there?</i>
- Whatever it is, it can't be good.

510
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:53,382
ROLAND:
The machines have taken Junction 21.

511
00:43:54,299 --> 00:43:57,427
The way I see it, if we drop down
from broadcast here...

512
00:43:57,594 --> 00:44:00,222
...intersect 153, we might surprise them.

513
00:44:00,764 --> 00:44:04,977
We'll go first, hammer as deep
as we can, then blow our EMP.

514
00:44:05,144 --> 00:44:09,148
Hopefully we can punch a hole
big enough for you to get through.

515
00:44:10,649 --> 00:44:15,487
It ain't pretty, but the way I see it,
it's the only way back.

516
00:44:15,654 --> 00:44:17,156
No, it's not.

517
00:44:17,322 --> 00:44:20,409
There's another way. A support line.

518
00:44:20,576 --> 00:44:24,329
It drops down right here,
1000 meters short of 21.

519
00:44:24,621 --> 00:44:28,542
If we're lucky, we may be able to
slip down without them ever knowing.

520
00:44:28,709 --> 00:44:31,128
That's a mechanical line.
It's impossible.

521
00:44:31,295 --> 00:44:33,338
- No one can pilot mechanical.
- I can.

522
00:44:33,505 --> 00:44:35,507
- Bullshit.
- I've done it.

523
00:44:35,674 --> 00:44:38,927
- That was a long time ago, Niobe.
- I said I can do it.

524
00:44:39,094 --> 00:44:43,724
So what? You'll be the only one that can.
There's no way we can follow you.

525
00:44:46,185 --> 00:44:47,811
Hi.

526
00:44:49,438 --> 00:44:54,026
I know time is always against us.
I'm sorry that I took so long.

527
00:44:54,193 --> 00:44:57,988
- But I wanted to be sure.
- Sure of what?

528
00:44:58,155 --> 00:45:00,282
- I know what I have to do.
- What?

529
00:45:00,449 --> 00:45:03,702
There's no easy way to say this,
so I'll just say it.

530
00:45:03,869 --> 00:45:06,538
- I have to take one of the ships.
- What?

531
00:45:06,705 --> 00:45:08,457
To go where?

532
00:45:09,374 --> 00:45:10,751
To the machine city.

533
00:45:13,962 --> 00:45:15,255
[LAUGHS]

534
00:45:15,464 --> 00:45:17,549
I know it's difficult to understand.

535
00:45:17,716 --> 00:45:20,260
No, it's not. You're out
of your goddamn mind.

536
00:45:20,552 --> 00:45:21,887
I still have to go.

537
00:45:22,054 --> 00:45:25,265
In 100 years, no ship has been
within 100 kilometers of it.

538
00:45:25,474 --> 00:45:28,143
- You'll never make it.
- I have to try.

539
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:31,313
- Is this what the Oracle has told you?
- No.

540
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:34,816
This is asinine. If you want
to kill yourself, do it...

541
00:45:34,983 --> 00:45:37,069
...but do it without
wasting our ships.

542
00:45:37,236 --> 00:45:40,197
- You have to believe me. I have to go.
- Bullshit!

543
00:45:40,364 --> 00:45:43,575
I am the captain of this ship.
I say where it has to go!

544
00:45:43,742 --> 00:45:47,579
And this ship will go to hell
long before I let you take it anywhere.

545
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:55,254
- He can take mine.
- You can't do that.

546
00:45:56,255 --> 00:45:59,216
Don't try to tell me
what I can or cannot do...

547
00:45:59,383 --> 00:46:01,677
...with my ship
after that little speech.

548
00:46:01,843 --> 00:46:06,265
- But for chrissake, Niobe--
- I'll pilot this ship, he can take mine.

549
00:46:06,807 --> 00:46:10,435
If we leave inside the hour,
we'll reach Zion as the machines do.

550
00:46:10,602 --> 00:46:13,146
That's as good a plan as any.

551
00:46:13,313 --> 00:46:17,067
It's a waste. A goddamn waste.

552
00:46:22,614 --> 00:46:25,784
Two ships, two directions.

553
00:46:25,951 --> 00:46:29,121
Sounds like providence,
doesn't it, Morpheus?

554
00:46:29,788 --> 00:46:32,958
- You've never believed in the One.
- I still don't.

555
00:46:33,125 --> 00:46:34,835
Then why are you doing this?

556
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:38,046
I believe in him.

557
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,883
Thank you.

558
00:46:46,805 --> 00:46:49,808
- What's that for?
- To help you relax.

559
00:46:49,975 --> 00:46:52,811
To make it easier for you to remember.

560
00:46:53,478 --> 00:46:55,647
What if I don't want to remember?

561
00:46:56,648 --> 00:46:58,734
Why would you want that?

562
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:01,987
What if I blew that EMP?

563
00:47:03,071 --> 00:47:04,990
What if I did destroy those ships...

564
00:47:05,157 --> 00:47:09,953
...and I am responsible
for the deaths of all those men?

565
00:47:11,997 --> 00:47:15,000
If I did that...

566
00:47:15,167 --> 00:47:18,920
...it wouldn't be very safe
for me here, would it?

567
00:47:26,219 --> 00:47:28,597
[GROANING]

568
00:47:28,764 --> 00:47:33,018
Of course, it might not be
very safe for you either.

569
00:47:40,859 --> 00:47:43,028
I'm ready.

570
00:47:44,112 --> 00:47:46,114
NEO:
Trinity...

571
00:47:47,032 --> 00:47:49,701
...there's something I have to say.

572
00:47:52,788 --> 00:47:55,624
Something you need to understand.

573
00:47:56,792 --> 00:47:59,669
I know I'm supposed to go.

574
00:47:59,836 --> 00:48:02,130
But beyond that...

575
00:48:03,131 --> 00:48:05,550
...I don't know. I....

576
00:48:05,717 --> 00:48:09,638
I know. You don't think
you're coming back.

577
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:16,269
I knew it the moment you said you had
to leave. I could see it in your face.

578
00:48:16,436 --> 00:48:19,106
Just like you knew the moment
you looked at me...

579
00:48:19,272 --> 00:48:21,650
...that I was coming with you.

580
00:48:23,777 --> 00:48:25,487
I'm scared, Trin.

581
00:48:25,821 --> 00:48:27,781
So am I.

582
00:48:28,573 --> 00:48:32,244
It took me 10 minutes
to buckle up one boot.

583
00:48:33,245 --> 00:48:35,330
But I'll tell you something.

584
00:48:35,497 --> 00:48:38,417
Six hours ago, I told the Merovingian...

585
00:48:38,583 --> 00:48:41,586
...I was ready to give anything
and everything for you.

586
00:48:44,089 --> 00:48:46,716
Do you know what's changed
in the last six hours?

587
00:48:46,883 --> 00:48:48,427
No.

588
00:48:48,969 --> 00:48:50,303
Nothing.

589
00:49:03,692 --> 00:49:05,986
ROLAND: <i>Finished loading ammunition?</i>
- Just about.

590
00:49:06,194 --> 00:49:08,488
Let's move it. We are out of time.

591
00:49:08,697 --> 00:49:10,949
You're not leaving them anything?

592
00:49:11,116 --> 00:49:13,285
He said he didn't need it.

593
00:49:17,205 --> 00:49:20,625
I ain't saying goodbye.
I'm saying good luck.

594
00:49:21,042 --> 00:49:22,878
Thank you.

595
00:49:27,716 --> 00:49:30,635
I can only hope you know
what you're doing.

596
00:49:30,802 --> 00:49:32,220
Me too.

597
00:49:36,433 --> 00:49:37,976
It was an honor, sir.

598
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:44,316
No, the honor is still mine.

599
00:49:58,163 --> 00:50:01,249
MAUSER: <i>We're ready, sir.</i>
- About damn time.

600
00:50:02,459 --> 00:50:06,046
We're already late, captain,
so let's hit it and hit it hard.

601
00:50:09,758 --> 00:50:11,676
Bye, baby.

602
00:50:11,843 --> 00:50:13,678
Take good care of them.

603
00:50:35,492 --> 00:50:37,285
Ready?

604
00:50:45,043 --> 00:50:47,087
Engine's still firing.

605
00:50:47,295 --> 00:50:49,881
Must be a fuse. I'll check it out.

606
00:51:03,812 --> 00:51:06,189
I should've known he'd
send his bitch first.

607
00:51:06,356 --> 00:51:07,691
Bane.

608
00:51:07,857 --> 00:51:10,986
No one ever got away from me
as many times as you did.

609
00:51:11,152 --> 00:51:13,154
Every time, I thought it was the last.

610
00:51:13,321 --> 00:51:17,158
Every time, I was sure we had you,
but you'd slip through our fingers.

611
00:51:17,325 --> 00:51:21,913
I really can't express
just how aggravating that can be.

612
00:51:22,581 --> 00:51:25,250
What are you talking about?

613
00:51:25,417 --> 00:51:30,672
I think I might enjoy killing you
as much as killing him.

614
00:51:46,688 --> 00:51:49,774
Neo, it's Bane. He's psychotic!

615
00:51:50,609 --> 00:51:53,194
You're gonna pay for that.

616
00:51:54,362 --> 00:51:57,282
GHOST: Twenty-seven kilometers to go.
AK: <i>We got an emergency.</i>

617
00:51:57,449 --> 00:51:59,951
ROLAND: What is it, AK?
<i>- It's Maggie, sir.</i>

618
00:52:00,118 --> 00:52:02,329
<i>She's dead, murdered.
I think it was Bane.</i>

619
00:52:02,495 --> 00:52:04,998
Goddamn it.

620
00:52:06,916 --> 00:52:10,337
I knew it. I knew he was
out of his goddamn mind.

621
00:52:10,503 --> 00:52:12,297
He fired that EMP.

622
00:52:12,464 --> 00:52:16,134
Goddamn it, I should have
beaten it out of him.

623
00:52:16,301 --> 00:52:19,220
We searched the whole ship, captain.
He ain't here.

624
00:52:20,889 --> 00:52:23,224
- I know where he is.

You can do it.

801
01:18:00,510 --> 01:18:03,221
Hurry. There's no time.

Captain...

803
01:18:06,183 --> 01:18:08,560
...I didn't finish the training program.

804
01:18:11,938 --> 01:18:13,565
Neither did I.

COLT: Kill the feeder!

We gotta blow the EMP now.

01:18:59,611 --> 01:19:01,488

Don't over-squeeze the trigger.

812
01:19:32,435 --> 01:19:34,437
Mifune's APU just reached Gate Three.

813
01:19:34,604 --> 01:19:37,399
- How much time?
OPERATOR: Two minutes to impact.

814
01:19:38,108 --> 01:19:41,903
- Captain Mifune, do you copy?
- I think his radio is down, sir.

815
01:19:42,070 --> 01:19:43,530
Mifune...

816
01:19:43,697 --> 01:19:45,323
...this is Lock.

817
01:19:45,532 --> 01:19:48,410

Do it, kid.

823
01:20:43,757 --> 01:20:46,676
Neo. I believe.

824
01:20:55,727 --> 01:20:57,771
- Yes!
- Can we make it?

825
01:20:59,105 --> 01:21:01,191
We ain't come this far.

826
01:21:13,370 --> 01:21:15,622
Almost home, almost home.

You're a hell of a pilot.

832
01:22:10,802 --> 01:22:14,097
Some things in this world never change.

833

I'm never gonna take it off.

842
01:23:14,157 --> 01:23:16,201
Three captains, one ship.

843
01:23:16,367 --> 01:23:20,371
I'll assume the other ships were lost
under equally pointless circumstances.

844
01:23:20,538 --> 01:23:22,165
Good to see you too, Jason.

845
01:23:22,332 --> 01:23:24,667
The Council's waiting to hear
your explanation.

846
01:23:24,834 --> 01:23:29,005
Forgive me for not attending,
but I have to try to salvage this debacle.

847
01:23:29,756 --> 01:23:32,342
Did I miss something?
I thought we saved the dock.

848
01:23:32,509 --> 01:23:34,344
That's the problem with you people.

849
01:23:34,511 --> 01:23:37,096
You can't think but five minutes
in front of you.

850
01:23:37,388 --> 01:23:40,975
That EMP knocked out almost every
piece of hardware and every APU.

851
01:23:41,142 --> 01:23:44,103
If I were the machines,
I'd send every sentinel here now.

852
01:23:44,395 --> 01:23:48,024
Save the dock, captain?
You handed it to them on a silver platter.

853
01:23:53,780 --> 01:23:55,782
Come on, get it cut.

854
01:23:57,367 --> 01:23:58,701
The bridge is clear.

855
01:24:01,287 --> 01:24:03,206

Get that cable run!

01:24:07,293 --> 01:24:11,089
- I want the system back online!
- It's the dock. They've got incoming.

858
01:24:12,382 --> 01:24:14,759
Order everyone to fall back.

01:24:14,926 --> 01:24:17,637

01:24:18,388 --> 01:24:20,056
Move it!

Oh, my God.

862
01:24:33,236 --> 01:24:35,405
- All clear.
- Do it.

Your move.

865
01:24:56,759 --> 01:24:58,469
So you gave them your ship?

866
01:24:58,928 --> 01:25:03,099
- That is correct, councillor, I did.
- Knowing what he planned to do with it?

867
01:25:04,767 --> 01:25:06,603
The Oracle said nothing of this?

868
01:25:07,604 --> 01:25:12,108
She told me Neo would need my help,
and I would choose to help him or not.

869
01:25:12,483 --> 01:25:16,946
But what hope can a single vessel have
against their entire defense system?

870
01:25:17,113 --> 01:25:20,325
None. It's completely impossible.
But he wouldn't listen.

871
01:25:20,491 --> 01:25:24,787
He wouldn't even take any ammunition.
He was totally out of his goddamn mind.

872
01:25:24,954 --> 01:25:27,790
No, he wasn't.

873
01:25:29,626 --> 01:25:32,295
Neo is doing what he believes
he must do.

874
01:25:33,671 --> 01:25:36,924
I don't know if what he's doing is right.
I don't know...

875
01:25:37,091 --> 01:25:39,719
...if he'll reach the machine city.

876
01:25:39,886 --> 01:25:43,139
And if he does, I don't know
what he can do to save us.

877
01:25:44,474 --> 01:25:49,187
But I do know that as long as there is
a single breath in his body...

878
01:25:50,647 --> 01:25:52,690
...he will not give up.

879
01:25:53,983 --> 01:25:55,485
And neither can we.

880
01:26:01,949 --> 01:26:03,326
Temperature's dropping.

881
01:26:06,829 --> 01:26:08,164
Here we go.

882
01:26:47,704 --> 01:26:49,455
We're over the fields, aren't we?

883
01:26:50,873 --> 01:26:52,208
How do you know that?

884
01:26:52,959 --> 01:26:54,836
I can feel them.

885
01:27:03,594 --> 01:27:05,221
Over there.

886
01:27:06,055 --> 01:27:09,892
There's our path. Can you see it?
Three lines.

887
01:27:10,059 --> 01:27:11,394
Power lines.

888
01:27:12,395 --> 01:27:14,147
Follow them.

889
01:27:31,080 --> 01:27:32,957

890
01:27:33,124 --> 01:27:34,834
I don't know.

01:28:07,158 --> 01:28:11,621
I recommend that the Council join the

01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:13,664
How long do we have?

898
01:28:14,123 --> 01:28:16,834
Two hours. Maybe less.

899
01:28:18,586 --> 01:28:22,799
My men have fortified the entrance with
enough artillery to make our last stand.

900
01:28:24,675 --> 01:28:27,178
Beyond that, there isn't anything more
I can do.

901
01:28:27,678 --> 01:28:31,140
Commander, do you think that
we have any chance of surviving?

902
01:28:32,850 --> 01:28:35,311
If I were you, I wouldn't
ask me that question.

01:28:36,479 --> 01:28:37,814
I would ask him.

01:28:38,689 --> 01:28:42,360
- Why?
- He's the one who believes in miracles.

There. Those mountains.

- Go up, over them.

- The sky! It's the only way.

01:31:06,337 --> 01:31:08,089

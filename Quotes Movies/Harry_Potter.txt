Hagrid:
You're the boy who lived.

Hagrid:
Who told you 'bout Fluffy?

Ron:
Fluffy?

Hermione:
That thing has a name?

Dumbledore:
It does not do to dwell on dreams, Harry, and forget to live.

Ron:
It's spooky! She knows more about you than you do!

Harry:
Who doesn't?

Mr. Ollivander:
I think it is clear that we can expect great things from you.

Dumbledore:
Dear Mr. Potter, we are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Soon, you and your schoolmates will join us here, and your education in the magical arts will begin.

Hermione:
Now, if you two don't mind, I'm going to bed before either of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed. Or worse, expelled.

Ron:
She needs to sort out her priorities.

Hagrid:
I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the...

Harry:
Yes?

Hagrid:
I shouldn't have told you that. No more questions, don't ask anymore questions!

Hermione:
Stop moving, both of you. This is devil's snare! You have to relax. If you don't, it'll only kill you faster!

Ron:
Kill us faster? Oh, now I can relax!

Hagrid:
You're a wizard, Harry!

Harry:
I'm a what?

Hermione:
Harry, no way! You heard what Madame Hooch said, besides, you don't even know how to fly!

Hermione:
What an idiot!

Hermione:
You'll be okay, Harry. You're a great wizard. You really are.

Harry:
Not as good as you.

Hermione:
Me? Books and cleverness. There are more important things: friendship and bravery. And Harry, just be careful.

Hermione:
Ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like . . real wizard's chess, do you?

Ron:
Yes Hermione, I think this is going to be exactly like wizard's chess.

Harry:
I swear I don't know. One second the glass was there and the next it was gone. It was like magic.

Uncle Vernon:
There is no such thing as magic!

Draco Malfoy:
Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask you yours. Red hair... and a hand-me-down robe... you must be a Weasley.

Dumbledore:
What happened in the dungeon between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so naturally, the whole school knows.

Dumbledore:
I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomit-flavored one, and since then I have rather lost my liking for them. But, I think I could be safe with a nice toffee.

Dumbledore:
...Hmm, alas, earwax.

Ron:
Wingardium leviosa!

Hermione:
Stop, stop stop! You're going to take someone's eye out. Besides, you're saying it wrong. It's Levi-o-sa, not Levio-sar

Ron:
You're a little scary sometimes, you know that. Brilliant. But scary.

Hagrid:
Dry up Dursley, you great prune!

Percy Weasley:
And keep an eye on the staircases. They like to change.

Hermione:
Look at you playing with your cards. Pathetic! We've got final exams coming up soon.

Ron:
I'm ready! Ask me any questions.

Hermione:
All right, what's the three most crucial ingredients in a Forgetfulness Potion?

Ron:
I forgot.

Hermione:
And what may I ask do you plan to do if this comes up in the final exam?

Ron:
Copy off you?

Hermione:
No, you won't! Besides, according to Professor McGonagall, we're to be given special quills bewitched with an anti-cheating spell.

Ron:
That's insulting! It's as if they don't trust us!

Aunt Petunia:
This is what you're going to be wearing when I finish dying it.

Harry:
But that's Dudley's old uniform! It'll fit me like bits of old elephant skin.

Professor Severus Snape:
For your information Potter, Asphodel and Wormwood making a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the draught of the living dead, a Beozar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and will save you from most poisons. As for Monkshood and Wolfsbane, they are the same plant which also goes by the name of Aconyte. Well, why aren't you all copying this down?

Harry:
Good of you to get us out of trouble like that.

Ron:
Mind you, we did save her life!

Harry:
Mind you, she might not have needed saving if you hadn't insulted her.

Ron:
What are friends for?

Hagrid:
Blimey, I'd love a dragon.

Harry:
You'd like a dragon?

Hagrid:
Fascinating but misunderstood beasts, Harry. Fascinating but misunderstood.

Professor Quirrel:
Troll! In the dungeons!

Professor Quirrel:
Thought you ought to know.

Seamus Finnigan:
I'm half and half. Dad's a muggle, Mam's a witch. Bit of a nasty shock for him when he found out.

Draco Malfoy:
So it's true then, what they were saying on the train. Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts.

Caretaker Argus Filch:
A pity they let the old punishment die... Was a time detention found you hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons... God, I miss the screaming.

Oliver Wood:
Scared, Harry?

Harry:
A little.

Oliver Wood:
It's all right. I felt the same way before my first game.

Harry:
What happened?

Oliver Wood:
Er, I don't really remember. I took a bludger to the head two minutes in. Woke up in the hospital a week later.

Dudley Dursley:
Daddy's gone mad hasn't he?

Professor McGonagall:
This boy will be famous. There won't be a child in our world who doesn't know his name.

Harry:
I can't be a wizard. I'm just Harry, just Harry.

Mr. Ollivander:
It's curious that you should be destined for this wand when its brother gave you that scar.

Professor Severus Snape:
There will be no foolish wand-waving or silly incantations in this class... As such, I don't expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science and exact art that is potion-making. However, for those select few

Professor Severus Snape:
, who possess, the pre-disposition... I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I can tell you how to bottle fame, brew glory, and even put a stopper in death.

Professor Severus Snape:
Then again, maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confident enough to NOT... PAY... ATTENTION.

Professor Severus Snape:
Mister Potter. Our... new... celebrity.

Neville Longbottom:
The only problem is I can't remember what I've forgotten.

Ron:
I think we've had a bad influence on her.

Ron:
It's you that has to go on, Harry. I know it. Not me. Not Hermione. You!

Dumbledore:
It takes a great deal of courage to stand up to your enemies, but a great deal more to stand up to your friends.

Dumbledore:
It was one of my more brilliant ideas. And between you and me, that is saying something.

Dumbledore:
And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a most painful death.

Ron:
That was bloody brilliant!

Professor McGonagall:
Well, thank you for that assessment, Mr Weasley. Perhaps it would be more useful if I were to transfigure Mr Potter and yourself into a pocket watch. That way, one of you might be on time.

Harry:
We got lost.

Professor McGonagall:
Then perhaps a map? I trust you don't need one to find your seats.

Ron:
What do they think they're doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?

Hermione:
You don't use your eyes, do you? Didn't you see what it was standing on?

Ron:
I wasn't looking at its feet! I was a bit preoccupied with its heads... or maybe you didn't notice? There were three!

Hagrid:
Isn't he beautiful? Oh, bless him! Look! He knows his mummy! 'alo Norbert!

Harry:
Norbert?

Hagrid:
Yeah, well, he's gotta have a name, don't he?

Ron:
Mental that one, I'm telling you.

Oliver Wood:
Nasty little buggers.

Hagrid:
Not all wizards are good.

Lord Voldemort:
There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it...

Professor Quirrel:
Yes, he does seem the type, doesn't he? Why, next to him, who would suspect p-p-poor, st-st-stuttering Professor Quirrell?

Ron:
Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, turn this stupid, fat rat yellow!

Uncle Vernon:
He'll not be going!

Hagrid:
Oh, and I suppose a great muggle like yourself is gonna stop him, are ya?

Harry:
I think if he had the chance, he would have killed me tonight.

Ron:
And to think, I've been worrying about my potions final.

Fred Weasley:
Well done, Harry. Wood just told us.

Ron:
Fred and George are on the team, too. Beaters.

George Weasley:
Our job is to make sure you don't get bloodied up too bad. Can't make any promises, though. Rough game, Quidditch.

Fred Weasley:
Brutal, but no one died in years. Someone will vanish occasionally, but they always turn up in a month or two!

Professor Severus Snape:
What would three young Gryffindors such as yourselves be doing inside... on a day like this?

Professor Severus Snape:
You ought to be more careful. People with think you're...

Professor Severus Snape:
up... to something.

Caretaker Argus Filch:
For God's sake, pull yourself together man. You're going into the Forest after all. Got to have your wits about you eh?

Draco Malfoy:
The Forest? I thought that was a joke. We can't go in there. Students aren't allowed. And there are...

Draco Malfoy:
...werewolves.

Caretaker Argus Filch:
Oh, there's more than werewolves in those trees, you can be sure of that. Nighty night.

Mr. Ollivander:
We can expect great things from you. After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things. Terrible, yes! But great!

Harry:
Excuse me sir, can you tell me where I might find Platform 9 and 3 quarters?

Station Guard:
9 and 3 quarters? Think you're being funny do ya?

Station Guard:
9 and 3 quarters!

Harry:
Sorry.

Hermione:
Sorry.

Ron:
It's for your own good, you know.

Ron:
I look good!

Sorting Hat:
Hmm, difficult. VERY difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind, either. There's talent, oh yes. And a thirst to prove yourself. But where to put you?

Harry:
Not Slytherin. Not Slytherin.

Sorting Hat:
Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure? You could be great, you know. It's all here in your head. And Slytherin can help you on your way to greatness, there's no doubt about that. No?

Harry:
Anything but Slytherin, anything but Slytherin.

Sorting Hat:
Then, better be... GRYFFINDOR!

Sorting Hat:
Ah! Another Weasley. I know just what to do with you.

Seamus Finnigan:
Eye of rabbit, heartstring hum, turn this water into rum.

Harry:
What's Seamus trying to do to that glass of water?

Ron:
Turn it into rum. He managed a weak tea yesterday before...

Professor McGonagall:
Are the rumors true, Albus?

Dumbledore:
I'm afraid so, Professor. The good... and the bad.

Hermione:
Honestly, don't you two read?

Draco Malfoy:
OK. Then I get Fang!

Hagrid:
Fine. Just so you know, he's a bloody coward.

Hermione:
That's totally barbaric!

Ron:
That's wizard's chess.

Harry:
Say, Percy, who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?

Percy Weasley:
That's Professor Snape, head of Slytherin House.

Harry:
What does he teach?

Percy Weasley:
Potions. But everyone knows it's the Dark Arts he fancies. He's been after Quirrell's job for *years*.

Draco Malfoy:
You'll soon find out that some wizarding families are better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort.

Harry:
I think I can pick out the wrong sorts, thank you.

Nearly Headless Nick:
Hello, how are you? Welcome to Gryffindor!

Professor Severus Snape:
There will be no foolish wand waving or silly incantations in this class.

Mr. Ollivander:
The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. It's not always clear why.

Hagrid:
What are you lookin' at?

Hagrid:
If that dolt of a cousin of yours, Dudley, gets up to any mischief, you could always threaten him with a nice pair of ears, to go with that tail.

Harry:
But, Hagrid, we,re not allowed to do magic outside Hogwarts.

Hagrid:
I know that, but your cousin don't, do he?

Professor Severus Snape:
Tell me, what would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?

Professor Severus Snape:
You don't know? Well, let's try again... Where, Mr. Potter, would you look if I asked you to get me a bezoar?

Harry:
I don't know, sir.

Professor Severus Snape:
And what is the difference between monkshood and wolfsbane?

Harry:
I don't know, sir.

Professor Severus Snape:
Pity... clearly, fame isn't everything, is it, Mr. Potter?

Snape:
Turn to page 394

Ron:
You're a little scary sometimes, You know that, brilliant, But Scary


Hermione:
Is that really what my hair looks like from the back?

Ron:
I'm warning you Hermione! Keep that bloody beast of yours away from Scabbers or I'll turn it into a tea cozy!

Hermione:
It's a cat, Ronald! What do you expect? It's in his nature.

Ron:
A cat? Is that what they told you? It looks more like a pig with hair if you ask me.

Hermione:
That's rich! Coming from the owner of that smelly old shoe brush. It's all right, Crookshanks, just ignore the mean little boy.

Professor Snape:
Well, well, Lupin. Out for a little walk... in the moonlight are we?

Hermione:
Did I mention it's the most haunted place in Britain?

Ron:
Twice.

Hermione:
Oh. Do you want to move a bit closer?

Ron:
Huh?

Hermione:
To the Shrieking Shack.

Ron:
Oh, no. I'm fine here.

Ron:
What the bloody hell was that all about?

Ron:
Bloody hell!

Hermione:
If you're going to kill Harry, you'll have to kill us, too.

Sirius Black:
Only one will die tonight.

Shrunken Head:
Watch your head!

Malfoy:
You're going to regret this.

Hagrid:
Class dismissed.

Malfoy:
You and your bloody chicken.

Professor Snape:
Expelliarmus! Ah vengeance is sweet. How I hoped I'd be the one to catch you.

Professor Snape:
I told Dumbledore you were helping an old friend enter the castle and now here's the proof.

Sirius Black:
Brilliant, Snape; once again you've put your keen and penetrating mind to the task and as usual come to the wrong conclusion. Now if you'll excuse us, Remus and I have some unfinished business to attend to.

Professor Snape:
Give me a reason. I beg you.

Professor Lupin:
Severus, don't be a fool.

Sirius Black:
He can't help it. It's habit by now.

Professor Lupin:
Sirius, be quiet...

Sirius Black:
Be quiet yourself, Remus!

Professor Snape:
Listen to you two, quarrelling like an old married couple.

Sirius Black:
Why don't you run along and play with your chemistry set?

Professor Snape:
I could do it you know. But why deny the Dementors? They're so longing to see you. Do I detect a flicker of fear? Ah yes. The Dementor's Kiss. One can only imagine what that must be like to endure. It's said to be nearly unbearable to witness but I'll do my best.

Hermione:
Ancient Egyptians used to worship cats, you know.

Ron:
Yeah, along with the dung beetle.

Harry:
Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs are proud to present the Marauder's Map.

George Weasley:
We owe them so much.

Harry:
Hang on. This is Hogwarts. And that... No. Is that really...?

Fred Weasley:
Dumbledore.

George Weasley:
In his study.

Fred Weasley:
Pacing.

George Weasley:
Does that a lot.

Harry:
So you mean this map shows...?

Fred Weasley:
Everyone.

Harry:
Everyone?

George Weasley:
Everyone.

Fred Weasley:
Where they are.

George Weasley:
What they're doing.

Fred Weasley:
Every minute.

George Weasley:
Of every day.

Harry:
Brilliant! Where'd you get it?

Fred Weasley:
Nicked it from Filch's office, of course, first year.

George Weasley:
Now, listen. There are seven secret passageways out of the castle. We'd recommend...

George Weasley:

Fred Weasley:
The One-Eyed Witch passageway.

George Weasley:
It'll lead you straight to Honeyduke's cellar.

Fred Weasley:
We best hurry. Filch is heading this way.

George Weasley:
Oh, and Harry, don't forget. When you're done, just give it a tap and say...

George Weasley:

Cornelius Fudge:
Now write your name only.

Dumbledore:
It's quite a long name.

Professor Trelawney:
Your aura is pulsing my dear. Are you in the beyond? I think you are.

Ron:
Sure...

Professor Trelawney:
Cup... tell me what you see.

Ron:
Oh yeah um... well um Harry got sort of a wonky cross,

Ron:
that's 'trials and suffering'. And that there could be the sun and thats

Ron:
'happiness'. So you're gonna suffer but you'll gonna be happy about it.

Ron:
Hermione, how did you get here?

Professor Lupin:
Eat this. It'll help.

Harry:
Why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me?

Professor Snape:
Have you any theories as to how Black got in?

Dumbledore:
Many, each as unlikely as the next.

Stan Shunpike:
Welcome to the Knight Bus, emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard. My name is Stan Shunpike and I will be your conductor this evening.

Harry:
I knew I could do it because I already saw myself do it. Does that make any sense?

Hermione:
No...

Hermione:
BUT I DON'T LIKE FLYING!

Ron:
There's something moving out there.

Sirius Black:
It's cruel that I got to spend so much time with James and Lily, and you so little. But remember, the ones who love us never truly leave us. They will always be found in here.

Dumbledore:
A word of caution: dementors are vicious creatures. They will not distinguish between the one they hunt and the one who gets in their way. Therefore I must warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you. It's not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving. But you know happiness can be found even in the darkest of times, when one only remembers to turn on the light.

Professor Lupin:
You know the very first time I saw you, Harry, I recognized you immediately. Not by your scar, by your eyes. They're your mother, Lily's. Yes, oh yes. I knew her. Your mother was there for me at a time when no one else was. Not only was she a singularly gifted witch, she was also an uncommonly kind woman. She had a way of seeing the beauty in others even more perhaps. Most especially when that person couldn't see it in themselves. Then your father, James on the other hand, he uh ha, he had a certain shall we say talent for trouble. The talent, rumor has it, he passed onto you. You are more like them than you know, Harry. In time you'll come to see just how much.

Ron:
Neville, you're supposed to stroke it!

Harry:
Expecto Patronum!

Professor Lupin:
You are not weak, Harry. The Dementors affect you more because there are true horrors in your past, horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine. You have nothing to be ashamed of.

Harry:
I'm scared, Professor.

Professor Lupin:
Well, I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.

Harry:
But the Muggles. Can't they see us?

Stan Shunpike:
Muggles? They don't see nothin', do they?

Shrunken Head:
No, but if you jab them with a fork, they feel.

Professor Lupin:
Come in. Now, I don't know how this map came to be in your possession but I am astounded that you didn't hand it in. Did it never occur to you that this in the hands of Sirius Black is a map to you?

Harry:
No sir.

Professor Lupin:
No. You know your father never set much store by the rules either but he and your mother gave their lives to save yours. And running around the castle at night unprotected with a killer on the loose seems to me to be a pretty poor way to repay them. Now I will not cover for you again Harry. I want you to return to your dormitory and stay there. And don't take any detours, if you do I shall know.

Cornelius Fudge:
As the Minister of Magic it is my duty to inform you, Mr Potter, that at approximately 7:30 this evening your uncle's sister was located a little south of Sheffield, circling a chimney stack. The Accidental Magic Reversal squad was dispatched immediately, she has been properly punctured and her memory modified. She will have no recollection of the event whatsoever so that's that and no harm done. Pea soup?

Harry:
No thank you. Minister?

Cornelius Fudge:
Yes?

Harry:
I don't understand.

Cornelius Fudge:
Understand?

Harry:
I broke the law. Underage wizards aren't allowed to use magic at home.

Cornelius Fudge:
Come now Harry, the Ministry doesn't send people to Azkaban for blowing up their aunts.

Harry:
Professor, why do the dementors affect me so?

Professor Lupin:
Listen, dementors are among the foulest creatures to walk this earth. They feed on every good feeling, every happy memory until a person is left with nothing but his worst experiences. The dementors affect you more than others because there are true horrors in your past, horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine. You are not weak Harry.

Harry:
Poor Professor Lupin is having a really tough night.

Professor Trelawney:
Here in this room, you will discover if you possess the Sight!

Professor Lupin:
Our pain becomes their power.

Harry:
Nice punch.

Hermione:
Thanks.

Hermione:
At least somebody's enjoying himself.

Sirius Black:
Come out, come out, Peter! Come out, come out and play!

Professor Snape:
Potter, what are you doing wandering the corridors at night?

Harry:
I was sleepwalking.

Professor Snape:
How extraordinarily like your father you are Potter; he too was exceedingly arrogant, strutting about the castle.

Harry:
My Dad didn't strut, and nor did I. And if you don't mind, I'd appreciate it if you lower your wand.

Dumbledore:
Well?

Harry:
We did it.

Dumbledore:
Did what? Good night.

Harry:
It's not exactly a happy memory... it's complicated.

Professor Lupin:
Is it strong?

Hermione:
Ow! That looks really painful.

Ron:
It's sorta painful. They uh, they might... chop it.

Hermione:
I'm sure Madame Pomfrey will fix it in a heartbeat.

Ron:
It's too late, it's ruined. It'll have to be chopped off.

Aunt Marge:
They use the cane at St. Brutus's, boy?

Harry:
Oh. Yeah, yeah. I... I've been beaten loads of times.

Stan Shunpike:
What you doin' down there?

Harry:
I fell over.

Stan Shunpike:
Well, what you fell over for?

Harry:
I didn't do it on purpose.

Stan Shunpike:
Well come on then! Let's not wait for the grass to grow!

Ginny Weasley:
The Fat lady... she is gone!

Ron:
Serves her right. She was a terrible singer...

Hermione:
That's not funny, Ron!

Ron:
So Sirius Black has broken out of Azkaban to come after you?

Hermione:
But they'll catch Black, won't they? I mean, everyone's looking for him.

Ron:
Sure... except no one's broken out of Azkaban before and he's a murderous, raving lunatic.

Harry:
Thanks, Ron.

Professor Snape:
That is the second time you have spoken out of turn, Miss Granger. Are you incapable of restraining yourself, or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all?

Ron:
He's got a point, you know.

Shrunken Head:
Ernie, little old lady at twelve o'clock!

Shrunken Head:
Ten... nine... eight... seven... six... five... four... 'tree'... 'tree' and a half... two... one and 'tree' quarters... YES!

Sirius Black:
Sorry about the bite, I reckon that twinges a bit.

Ron:
A bit? A bit? You almost tore my leg off!

Sirius Black:
I *was* going for the rat. Normally, I have a very sweet disposition as a dog. In fact, more than once, James suggested that I make the change permanent. The tail I could live with. But the fleas? They're murder.

Harry:
I didn't mean to blow her up, I just... lost control.

Ron:
Brilliant!

Hermione:
Honestly Ron, it's not funny! Harry was lucky not to be expelled.

Harry:
I think I was lucky not to have been arrested actually.

Ron:
I still think it's brilliant.

Ron:
She's gone mental, Hermione has! I mean, not that she wasn't always. But, now it's out there in the open for everyone to see.

Sirius Black:
Enough talk, let's kill him!

Professor Lupin:
Wait!

Sirius Black:
I DID MY WAITING! TWELVE YEARS OF IT! IN AZKABAN!

Young Witch Maid:
Housekeeping!

Young Witch Maid:
I'll come back later.

Stan Shunpike:
What did you say your name was again?

Harry:
I didn't.

Stan Shunpike:
Well, whereabout are you headed?

Harry:
The Leaky Cauldron! That's in London.

Stan Shunpike:
D'you hear that, Ern? The Leaky Cauldron that's in London.

Shrunken Head:
Ah, the Leaky Cauldron! You get the pea soup, make sure you eat it before it eats you!

George Weasley:
Not flashing that clipping again, are you, Ron?

Ron:
I haven't shown anyone!

Fred Weasley:
No, not a soul! Unless you count Tom.

George Weasley:
The day maid.

Fred Weasley:
The night maid.

George Weasley:
The cook.

Fred Weasley:
That bloke who came to fix the toilet.

George Weasley:
And that wizard from Belgium!

Percy Weasley:
I'm Head Boy!

Dumbledore:
For in dreams, we enter a world that's entirely our own.

Peter Pettigrew:
What would you have done, Sirius?

Sirius Black:
I would have died. Died rather than betray my friends, Peter.

Sirius Black:
Pettigrew's alive! And he's right there!

Ron:
Me? He's mental!

Sirius Black:
Not you! Your rat!

Hagrid:
Well, first the committee took turns in talking about 'why we were there'. Then I stood up and said my bit, how Buckbeak was a good hippogriff, always cleaned his feathers. And then Lucius Malfoy got up...

Dumbledore:
Professor Kettleburn, our Care of Magical Creatures teacher for many years, has decided to retire in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs.

Hagrid:
First thing you wanna know about hippogriffs, is that they're very proud creatures, very easily offended. You do not want to insult a hippogriff. It may just be the last thing you ever do. Now, who'd like to come and say hello?

Hagrid:
Well done, Harry, well done!

Harry:
But the Muggles! Can't they see us?

Stan Shunpike:
Muggles? They don't see nothing, do they?

Shrunken Head:
Yeah, but if you jab them with a fork, they feel it!

Cornelius Fudge:
You will be pleased to hear that two members of the Accidental Magical Reversal Department were dispatched to Privet Drive a few hours ago. Miss Dursley has been punctured and her memory has been modified. She has no recollection of the incident at all. So that's that, and no harm done.

Harry:
Professor, can I ask you something?

Professor Lupin:
You want to know why I stopped you fighting the boggart that other day? I would have thought that was obvious. I assumed that if you faced the boggart, it would assume the shape of Lord Voldemort.

Harry:
I did think of him at first. But then I remembered that night on the train. I thought of those dementors.

Professor Lupin:
I'm impressed, Harry. That suggests that what you fear most of all... is fear. Very wise.

Harry:
Lumos Maxima!

Hermione:
Harry, Harry!

Hermione:
So rude!

Ron:
Thick-heads.

Aunt Marge:
Do they use the cane at St. Brutus', boy?

Harry:
[catching Uncle Vernon's eye; sarcastically] Oh yeah, yeah, I've been beaten loads of times.

Aunt Marge:
Excellent. I won't hear any of this namby-pamby, wishy-washy nonsense about not beating someone when they deserve it. You mustn't blame yourself about how this one turned out, Vernon. It's all to do with blood. Bad blood will out. What is it that the boy's father did, Petunia?

Petunia:
Oh, nothing. He didn't work. He was unemployed.

Aunt Marge:
And a drunk too, no doubt?

Harry:
[irritated] That's a lie!

Aunt Marge:
What did you say?

Harry:
[getting angry] My dad wasn't a drunk!

[The glass Aunt Marge is holding suddenly breaks, causing the Dursleys to yelp]

Aunt Marge:
[notices what just happened] Oh, don't worry. Don't fuss, Petunia. I have a very firm grip.

Uncle Vernon:
[sternly to Harry] I think it's time you went to bed.

Aunt Marge:
Actually, it's nothing to do with the father, it has to do with the mother. You see it all the time with dogs. If there's something wrong with the b*tch, then there's something wrong with the pup.

Harry:
[yelling angrily at Aunt Marge with a snap] SHUT UP! SHUT UP!!

Aunt Marge:
Mm. Right! Let me tell you... y-y-- [Her finger starts to inflate.]

[A short time later, Harry is about to leave the house shortly after inflating Aunt Marge for insulting his parents and she flew away]

Uncle Vernon:
[angrily, shouting at the top of his lungs at Harry] You bring her back!! You bring her back now, you put her right!

Harry:
No! She deserved what she got! [Uncle Vernon furiously tries to grab Harry with a savage yell, but Harry stands up to him with his wand] Keep away from me.

Uncle Vernon:
You're not allowed to do magic outside school.

Harry:
Yeah? Try me.

Uncle Vernon:
They won't let you back now. You have nowhere to go.

Harry:
I don't care. Anywhere's better than here. [angrily leaves the house and storms off]

Fred:
You're not flashing that clipping about again, are you Ron?

Ron:
I haven't shown anyone!

George:
No, not a soul!

Fred:
Not unless you count Tom...

George:
The day maid...

Fred:
The night maid...

George:
That bloke came to who fix the toilet...

Fred:
And that wizard from Belgium!

The Fat Lady:
[In a painting; she sings while holding a glass] Ah ah ah ahhh!

Harry:
Fortuna Major.

The Fat Lady:
No, wait, wait! [Sings in a higher pitch] Ah ah ah ahhh!

Harry:
[Irritated] Fortuna Major.

The Fat Lady:
No, no, no! Wait, wait! Watch this! [Screams] Ah ah ah AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH! [The Fat Lady surreptitiously looks around to make sure nobody's watching, then smashes the glass on a pillar in the painting] Oh, amazing! Just with my voice!

Harry:
[Impatient] Fortuna Major!

The Fat Lady:
[Petulant] Yes, all right, all right, you can go in.

[The door behind her opens to let the students in.]

Harry:
[Exasperated] Thank you!

The Fat Lady:
Plebs.

[Harry's lying in the hospital wing, unconscious, after getting injured during a Quidditch game.]

Ron:
He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?

George:
Peaky?

Fred:
What do you expect? He fell over 100 feet.

George:
Yeah, Ron. Let's walk you off the top of the Astronomy tower.

Fred:
And see what you look like.

Harry:
[coming to] Probably a right sight better than he normally does.

George:
Gave us a right good scare there, mate.

Hermione:
Harry, are you all right?

Harry:
[jokingly] Brilliant. [serious again] What happened?

Ron:
Well, you fell off your broom.

Harry:
[sarcastically] Oh, really? I meant the match. Who won?

Hermione:
Um... no one blames you, Harry. The Dementors aren't supposed to come inside the grounds. Dumbledore was furious. As soon as he saved you, he sent them straight off.

Ron:
There's um... something else you should know about, too, Harry. When you fell, your broom, it sort of blew into the Whomping Willow and... [Holds up what's left of the destroyed handle of Harry's Nimbus 2000] ...Well.

Harry:
[looking at the Marauder's Map for the first time] Hang on. This is Hogwarts. And that... no. Is that really...?

Fred:
Dumbledore...

George:
In his study....

Fred:
Pacing...

George:
Does that a lot.

Harry:
So this map shows...

Fred:
Everyone.

Harry:
Everyone?

George:
Everyone.

Fred:
Where they are...

George:
...what they're doing...

Fred:
...every minute...

George:
...of every day!

Harry:
Brilliant!

[Professor Snape has caught Harry in a hallway.]

Professor Snape:
Potter. What are you doing wandering the corridors at night?

Harry:
I was sleepwalking.

Snape:
How extraordinarily like your father, you are, Potter. He too was exceedingly arrogant, strutting about the castle.

Harry:
[irritated] My dad didn't strut. And nor do I. Now if you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you would lower your wand.

Snape:
[Lowers his wand, level with the pocket on the hooded sweater Harry is wearing] Turn out your pockets. [Harry just stands there] [sternly] Turn out your pockets. [Harry takes out the Marauder's Map] What's this?

Harry:
Spare bit of parchment.

Snape:
Really? Open it. [Harry opens the map; Snape puts his wand on the map] Reveal your secrets. [To Harry, as the logo seems to appear] Read it.

Harry:
[reading the map's text] Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs... offer their compliments to Professor Snape and...

Snape:
Go on.

Harry:
[still reading, amused] ...and request that he keep his abnormally large nose out of other people's business.

Snape:
Why you insolent, little--!

Professor Lupin:
[approaching Snape from the back] Professor.

Snape:
Well, well. Lupin. Out for a little walk in the moonlight, are we?

Lupin:
[to Harry] Harry, are you all right?

Snape:
That remains to be seen. [takes the Marauder's Map] I have just now confiscated a rather curious artifact from Mr. Potter. Take a look, Lupin. Supposed to be your area of expertise. Clearly, it's full of Dark Magic.

Lupin:
I seriously doubt it, Severus. It looks to me as though it's merely a parchment designed to insult anyone who tries to read it. [chuckles] I suspect it's a Zonko product. Nevertheless, I shall investigate any hidden qualities it may possess. It is, after all, as you say, my area of expertise. [to Harry] Harry, would you come with me, please. [to Professor Snape] Professor, good night.

[Hermione sees Malfoy laughing about Buckbeak, Hagrid's hippogriff, being executed that night.]

Draco Malfoy:
[to Crabbe and Pike] Father said I could have the hippogriff's head. Maybe I'll donate it to the Gryffindor Common Room.

Crabbe:
Look who's here.

Draco Malfoy:
Ah! Come to see the show?

Hermione:
[furiously] You! You foul, loathsome, evil, little cockroach! [holds Malfoy at wandpoint]

Ron:
Hermione, no! He's not worth it!

[Hermione relaxes and takes her wand away from Malfoy, but almost immediately punches him in the face. He and his gang run off, panicking.]

Hermione:
That felt good.

Ron:
[impressed] Not good. Brilliant!

Lupin:
Severus, don't be a fool.

Sirius:
He can't help it Remus, it's habit by now.

Lupin:
Sirius, be quiet.

Sirius:
Be quiet yourself, Remus!

Snape:
Oh listen to you two, quarreling like an old married couple.

Sirius:
Why don't you run along and play with your chemistry set?

Snape:
[puts wand on Sirius' throat] I could do it, you know? But why deny the Dementors, when they're so longing to see you? Do I detect a flicker of fear? Ah yes, a Dementor's Kiss. One can only imagine what that must be like to endure. It's said to be nearly unbearable to witness but I'll do my best!

Harry:
Tell me about Peter Pettigrew.

Lupin:
He was at school with us. We thought he was our friend.

Harry:
No. Pettigrew's dead. [to Sirius] You killed him!

Lupin:
No he didn't. I thought so too until you mention seeing Pettigrew on the map.

Harry:
The map was lying, then.

Sirius:
The map never lies! Pettigrew's alive! And he's [points to Scabbers] right there!

Ron:
Me?! He's mental!

Sirius:
Not you! You're rat!

Ron:
Scabbers has been in my family for...

Sirius:
Twelve years? Curiously long life for a common garden rat! He's missing a toe, isn't he?

Ron:
So what?!

Harry:
All they could find left of Pettigrew was his...

Sirius:
Finger! But then the dirty coward cut it off so that everyone would think he was dead! And then he transformed into a rat!

Harry:
Show me. [Sirius tries to take the rat from Ron, but Ron holds onto it] Give it to him, Ron.

Ron:
What are you trying do to him? [Sirius finally gets a hold of the rat] Scabbers! Leave him alone! [tries to run toward Sirius, but Hermione holds him back] Get off him! What are you doing? Scabbers!

[Sirius drops the rat, which runs while Sirius finally transforms it into Peter Pettigrew; he and Remus pull him out of the hole, Ron has a shocked look on his face]

Peter Pettigrew:
[realizes he's not a rat anymore] Remus? S-Sirius? My old friends! [runs toward the door, but Lupin and Sirius block him] Harry. Look at you. [walks toward Harry] You look so much like your father. Like James! We were the best of friends...

Sirius:
How dare you speak to Harry?! [Pettigrew scowls and runs away from Sirius] How dare you talk about James in front of him?!

Lupin:
You sold James and Lily to Voldemort, didn't you?!

Pettigrew:
I didn't mean to! The Dark Lord. You have no idea the weapons he possesses! Ask yourself, Sirius! What would you've done? What would you've done?

Sirius:
I would have died! [Pettigrew crawls under piano] I would have died rather than betray my friends!

Pettigrew:
[runs over to Harry, whispering to him] Harry, James wouldn't have wanted me killed! Your dad... your dad would have spared me! He would shown me mercy...!

[Lupin and Sirius yank him off Harry]

Sirius:
Should've realized, Peter, that if Voldemort didn't kill you, then we would! [he and Lupin pull out their wands and point them and Pettigrew] Together!

Harry:
No!

Lupin:
Harry, this man is...

Harry:
I know what he is. But we'll take him up to the castle.

Pettigrew:
Bless you, boy! Bless you!

[kneels to Harry]

Harry:
Get off! I said we'll take you to the castle. After that, the dementors can have you.

Sirius:
It's beautiful, isn't it? I'll never forget the first time I walked through those doors. It'll be nice to do it again as a free man. That was a noble thing you did back there. He doesn't deserve it.

Harry:
Well, I just didn't think my dad would've wanted his two best friends to become killers. Besides, dead the truth dies with him. Alive, you're free.

Pettigrew:
Turn me into a maggot! Turn me into a flobberworm! Anything but the dementors! Ron! Haven't I been a good friend? A good pet? You won't let them give me to the dementors, will you? I was your rat! Sweet girl! Clever girl! Surely you won't let them...

Ron:
[to Harry and Hermione, who have just disappeared and reappeared in thin air] How did you get there? I was just talking to you there! And now you're there!

Hermione:
What's he talking about, Harry?

Harry:
I don't know. Honestly Ron, how can somebody be in two places at once?

Draco Malfoy:
God, this place has gone to the dogs. Wait until my father hears that Dumbledore's got this oaf teaching classes.

[He, Crabbe, and Pike laugh]

Harry:
Shut up, Malfoy.

Draco, Crabbe, and Pike:
Ooh. [Draco drops his bag on Crabbe and faces Harry as if to fight him then he points] Dementor, Dementor.

[Harry and everyone else looks around startled. With their backs turned many Slytherins, including Pike and all the members of Malfoy's gang, cover their heads, in an attempt to resemble the Dementors.]

Slytherin students:
Oooooooooooh!

Lupin:
Very well, Kill him. But wait one more minute Harry has the right to know why.

Harry:
(to Sirius) I know why! You betrayed my parents! You're the reason they're dead!

Lupin:
No, Harry, it wasn't him. Somebody did betray your parents but it was somebody who, until quite recently, I believed to be dead!

Harry:
Who was it then?!

Sirius:
Peter Pettigrew! And he's in this room, right now! Come out, come out, Peter! Come out, come out and play!

Snape:
[barges in and disarms Sirius' wand] Expelliarmus!

Draco Malfoy:
Potter? [Harry turns] Is it true you fainted? [Pike pretends to swoon] I mean that you actually fainted?!

Ron:
[turning Harry away] Shove off, Malfoy!

Aunt Marge:
Do they use the cane at St Brutus's, boy?

Harry:
[catching Uncle Vernon's eye] Oh yeah, yeah, I've been beaten loads of times.

Aunt Marge:
Excellent. I won't hear any of this namby-pamby, wishy-washy nonsense about not beating someone when they deserve it.

Petunia:
Oh, nothing. He didn't work. He was unemployed.

Aunt Marge:
And a drunk too, no doubt?

Harry:
[irritated] That's a lie!

Aunt Marge:
What did you say?

Harry:
[getting angry] My dad wasn't a drunk!

[The glass Aunt Marge is holding suddenly breaks. Everyone screams.]

Aunt Marge:
Oh, don't worry. Don't fuss, Petunia. I have a very firm grip.

Uncle Vernon:
I think it's time you went to bed.

Aunt Marge:
Actually it has nothing to do with the father, it has to do with the mother. You see, all the time with dogs. If there's something wrong with the b*tch, then there's something wrong with the pup.

Harry:
[yelling angrily at Aunt Marge with a snap] SHUT UP! SHUT UP!!

Uncle Vernon:

Harry:
I don't care. Anywhere's better than here. [angrily leaves the house and storms off]

Ron:
I'm warning you, Hermione! Keep that bloody beast of yours away from Scabbers, or I'll turn it into a tea cozy!

Hermione:
It's a cat, Ronald; what do you expect? It's in his nature.

Ron:
A cat? Is that what they told you? Looks more like a pig with hair if you ask me!

Hermione:
That's rich, coming from the owner of that smelly old shoebrush.

Fred:
You're not flashing that clipping about again, are you Ron?

Ron:
I haven't shown anyone!

George:
No, not a soul!

Fred:
Not unless you count Tom...

George:
The day maid...

Fred:

George:

Fred:

Harry:
[Impatient] Fortuna Major!

The Fat Lady:
[Petulant] Yes, all right, all right, you can go in.

[Harry is in the room under the Invisibility Cloak]

Madame Rosmerta:
Nobody's gonna come to a pub where they'll get scared out of their wits.

Professor McGonagall:
Professor Dumbledore doesn't want dementors around the place, I can assure you.

Madame Rosmerta:
Now, tell me what this is all about.

Professor McGonagall:
Years ago, when Harry Potter's parents realized they were marked for death, do you remember? They went into hiding. Few knew where they were. One who did, was Sirius Black. And he told You-Know-Who.

Cornelius Fudge:
Not only did Black lead You-Know-Who to the Potters that night, but he also killed one of their friends, Peter Pettigrew.

Madame Rosmerta:
Peter Pettigrew?

Professor McGonagall:
Little lump of a boy, always trailing after Sirius Black.

Madame Rosmerta:
Oh, I remember him. Never let James and Sirius out of his sight. But what happened?

Professor McGonagall:
Well, Peter Pettigrew tried to warn the Potters, and might have managed to if he hadn't run into an old friend.

Cornelius Fudge:
Black was vicious. He didn't kill Pettigrew. He destroyed him! A finger! That's all that was left, a finger! Nothing else.

Professor McGonagall:
Yes. Sirius Black may not have put his hands to the Potters, but he's the reason they're dead.

Cornelius Fudge:
And now he wants to finish what he started.

Madame Rosmerta:
I don't believe it.

Cornelius Fudge:
That's not the worst of it.

Madame Rosmerta:
What could be worse?

Professor McGonagall:
This: Sirius Black was, and remains to this day…Harry Potter's godfather!

[Having learned this, Harry runs out of the room sobbing and into a clearing in the forest]

Hermione:
[removes the cloak off him] Harry, what happened?

Harry:
[quietly] He was their friend… and he betrayed them. [yelling] HE WAS THEIR FRIEND! [echoes] I hope he finds me. 'Cause when he does, I'm gonna be ready. When he does, I'm gonna kill him!

[Harry and Hermione enter the Shrieking Shack and find Ron in a room]

Harry:
Ron!

Hermione:
Ron, you're okay!

Harry:
The dog. Where is it?!

Ron:
Harry, it's a trap! [points to Sirius standing behind the door] He's the dog! He's an Animagus!

[Harry and Hermione look down on the floor and follow the paw prints to where Sirius is standing]

Hermione:
[protecting Harry behind her] If you want to kill Harry, you'll have to kill us too!

Sirius:
No. Only one will die tonight.

Harry:
Then it'll be you! [angrily rushes over to Sirius, holds him down, and threateningly points his wand at him]

Sirius:
[chuckles] Are you going to kill me, Harry?

Lupin:
[enters the room and disarms Harry's wand] Expelliarmus! [orders Harry to step aside] Well, well, Sirius. Looking rather ragged aren't we? Finally the flesh reflects the madness within.

Sirius:
Well, you'd know all about the madness within, wouldn't you, Remus? [Lupin smiles, helps him get back up on his feet, and they hug] I found him.

Lupin:
I know.

Sirius:
He's here!

Lupin:
I understand.

Sirius:
Let's kill him!

Hermione:
NO! I trusted you! And all this time, you've been his friend. He's a werewolf! That's why he's been missing classes.

Lupin:
How long have you known?

Hermione:
Since Professor Snape set the essay.

Lupin:
Well, well, well, Hermione. You really the brightest witch of your age I've ever met.

Sirius:
Enough talk, Remus! Come on! Let's kill him!

Lupin:
Wait!

Sirius:
I DID MY WAITING!!! TWELVE YEARS OF IT!!! IN AZKABAN!!!

Lupin:
Very well. Kill him. But wait one more minute, Harry has the right to know why.

Harry:
I know why! You betrayed my parents! You're the reason they're dead!

Lupin:
No, Harry, it wasn't him. Somebody did betray your parents but it was somebody who, until quite recently, I believed to be dead!

Harry:
Who was it then?!?

Sirius:
Peter Pettigrew! And he's in this room, right now! Come out, come out, Peter! Come out, come out and play!

[last lines]

[the Gryffindors are gathered around the table around a wrapped package]

Ron:
I didn't mean to open it, Harry. It was badly wrapped. [to Fred and George] They made me do it.

Fred and George:
Did not!

[Harry opens the package to reveal a Firebolt]

Ron:
It's the fastest broom in the world.

Harry:
But who sent it?

Ron:
No one knows.

[Hermione holds up a hippogriff feather]

Hermione:
This came with it.

[Outside the school, the Gryffindors watch Harry take the Firebolt for a ride with Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle watching looking jealous]

Harry Potter:
(Hermione: Harry, what happened?) [quietly] He was their friend, and he betrayed them. [yelling] HE WAS THEIR FRIEND!!!!!!!! [echoes] I hope he finds me! 'Cause when he does, I'm gonna be ready! When he does, I'm gonna kill him!

Harry Potter:
[to Sirius] You betrayed my parents! You're the reason they're dead!

Harry Potter:
I just didn't think my dad would've wanted his two best friends to become killers. Besides, dead the truth dies with him. Alive, you're free.

Harry Potter:
You see Sirius talking to me there? He's asking me to come and live with him. (Hermione: That's great.) When we free him, I'll never have to go back to the Dursley's. It'll just be me and him. We could live in the country, someplace you can see the sky. I think he'll like that after all those years in Azkaban.

Harry Potter:
Honestly, Ron. How can somebody be in two places at once?

Harry Potter:
(Last lines) Lumos. I solemnly swear that I am up to no good. [credits roll] Mischief managed. Nox. [screen goes black, ending the movie]

Ron Weasley:
Bloody hell, Harry! That was not funny!

Ron Weasley:
What's up, Malfoy? Lost your skis?

Ron Weasley:
[sees and points to the Grim appearing behind Harry and Hermione] Harry, Hermione, RUN! It's the Grim!

Ron Weasley:
[Observing his leg after Sirius, as a dog, attacked him.] It's too late. It's ruined. It'll have to be chopped off.

Ron Weasley:
What are you trying do to him? [Sirius snatches Scabbers from Ron] Scabbers! Leave him alone! Get off 'im! What're ya doing?

Hermione Granger:
[To Malfoy] You! You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!

Hermione Granger:
[To Professor Lupin after learning he and Sirius are old friends] NO! I trusted you! And all this time, you've been his friend. He's a werewolf! That's why he's been missing classes. (Professor Lupin: How long have you known?) Since Professor Snape set the essay.

Hermione Granger:
[To Harry after blasting a disarming charm on Snape] You attacked a teacher!

Draco Malfoy:
[to Hagrid after Buckbeak attacks him] It's killed me! It's killed me! You'll regret this! You and your bloody chicken...

Draco Malfoy:
[to Ron and Hermione] Well, well, look who's here! You two shopping for your new dream home? Don't your family sleep in a one room? ... Oh, not very friendly. Boys! I think it's time we teach Weaselbee how to respect his superiors.

Draco Malfoy:
“Dementor! Dementor!” [Attempting to scare Harry]

Dumbledore:
For in dreams, we enter a world that is entirely our own. Let him swim in the deepest of oceans or glide over the highest cloud.

Dumbledore:
A child's voice, however honest and true, is meaningless to those who've forgotten how to listen.

Dumbledore:
(to Harry and Hermione) Mysterious thing, time. Powerful, and when meddled with, dangerous. Sirius Black is in the topmost cell of the dark tower. You know the laws, Miss Granger. You must not be seen. And you would do well, I feel, to return before this last chime. If not, the consequences are too ghastly to discuss. If you succeed tonight, more than one innocent life may be spared. Three turns, should do it, I think. Oh, and by the way. When in doubt, I find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin. Good luck.

Professor Lupin:
[to Sirius] Well, well, Sirius. Looking rather ragged aren't we? Finally the flesh reflects the madness within.

Sirius Black:
No, only one will die tonight.

Sirius Black:
The map never lies! Pettigrew's alive! And he's right there!

Sirius Black:
[referring to his dog form] I actually have quite a pleasant disposition as a dog; so much so, in fact, that more than once, James suggested that I make the change permanent. The tail I could live with, but the fleas...they're murder.

Sirius Black:
[to Ron] Sorry about the bite. I reckon that stings a bit.

Sirius Black:
[to Harry] Besides, the ones that love us never really leave us. You can always find them… [puts hand over Harry's heart] in here.

Sirius Black:
Brilliant, Snape. Once again you put your keen and penetrating mind to the task and, as usual, come to the wrong conclusion. Now if you'll excuse us, Remus and I have some unfinished business to attend to.

Sirius Black:
Well, you'd know all about the madness within, wouldn't you, Remus?

Sirius Black:
[to Snape] Why don't you run along and play with your chemistry set.

Sirius Black:
That was a noble thing you did back there. He doesn't deserve it.

Sirius Black:
I don't know if you know, Harry. But when you were born, James and Lily made me your godfather.

Cornelius Fudge:
Come now, Harry. The Ministry doesn't send people to Azkaban for blowing up their aunts.

Cornelius Fudge:
Not only did Black lead You-Know-Who to the Potters that night, but he also killed one of their friends, Peter Pettigrew.

Cornelius Fudge:
Black was vicious. He didn't kill Pettigrew... he destroyed him!

The Marauder'S Map:
Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs are proud to present the Marauder's Map.

The Marauder'S Map:
Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs offer their compliments to Professor Snape and request that he keep his abnormally large nose out of other people's business.

Dre Head:
Yeah, take it away, Ernie. It's goin' to be a BUMP-Y ride!

Dre Head:
[Harry states his destination] The Leaky Cauldron. Hey, you got the pea soup? Make sure you eat it before it eats you!

Dre Head:
[After the bus squeezes between two double-decker buses] Hey, guys, guys! Why the long faces?

Dre Head:
[The bus arrives outside the Leaky Cauldron] Yeah. Yeah. Nearly there. Nearly there. Nearly there. [The bus bumps into a muggle car upon stopping] Next stop, Knockturn Alley.

Harry Potter:
[reading his welcoming letter] Dear Mr. Potter, We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

Draco Malfoy:
You'll soon find out that some wizarding families are better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.

Severus Snape:
[entering class room] There will be no foolish wand-waving or silly incantations in this class. As such, I don't expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science and exact art that is potion-making. However, for those select few who possess the predisposition, I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I can tell you how to bottle fame, brew glory, and even put a stopper in death. Then again, maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confident enough to not pay attention! Mr. Potter. Our new celebrity. Tell me, what would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood? You don't know? Well, let's try again. Where, Mr. Potter, would you look if I asked you to find me a bezoar?...And what is the difference between monkshood and wolfsbane?...Pity. Clearly, fame isn't everything, is it, Mr. Potter?

Dumbledore:
It does not do to dwell on dreams, and forget to live.

Dumbledore:
To the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.

Dumbledore:
The truth is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with caution.

Dumbledore:
Only a person who wanted to find the Stone - find it, but not use it - would be able to get it. That is one of my more brilliant ideas. And between you and me, that is saying something.

Lord Voldemort:
There is no good and evil. There is only power... and those too weak to seek it.

[First lines]

Dumbledore:
(To cat) I should have known that you would be here... Professor McGonagall.

(The cat turns into McGonagall)

McGonagall:
Good evening, Professor Dumbledore. Are the rumors true, Albus?

Dumbledore:
I'm afraid so, Professor. The good and the bad.

McGonagall:
And the boy?

Dumbledore:
Hagrid is bringing him.

McGonagall:
Do you really think it wise trusting Hagrid with something as important as this?

Dumbledore:
Ah, Professor. I would trust Hagrid with my life.

(Hagrid appears on a flying motorcycle)

Hagrid:
Professor Dumbledore, sir. Professor McGonagall.

Dumbledore:
Ah, Hagrid. No trouble, I assume?

Hagrid:
No, sir. Little tyke fell asleep just as we were flying over Bristol. (hands Dumbledore a bundle - Harry) Try not to wake him.

(Dumbledore takes Harry and heads for the Dursleys)

McGonagall:
Do you think it's safe, leaving him with these people? I've watched them all day, they're the worst sort of... Muggles imaginable. They really are--

Dumbledore:
The only family he has.

McGonagall:
This boy will be famous. There won't be a child in our world that doesn't know his name.

Dumbledore:
Exactly. He's better off growing up away from all that... until he is ready.

(Dumbledore places Harry on the doorstep. Hagrid snivels.)

Dumbledore:
There, there, Hagrid. It's not really goodbye, after all.

(Hagrid nods)

Dumbledore:
(Places a letter on Harry) Good luck... Harry Potter.

Dudley:
How many are there?!

Uncle Vernon:
36, counted them myself.

Dudley:
36?! But last year, last year I got 37!

Uncle Vernon:
Well, some are a bit bigger than last year's -

Dudley:
I DON'T CARE HOW BIG THEY ARE!

Uncle Vernon:
[grabs Harry by the hair] What happened?!

Harry:
I swear, I don't know! One minute, the glass was there and then it was gone! It was like magic!

Uncle Vernon:
[puts Harry in the stairway, in a fierce tone] There's no such thing as magic! [slam the door]

Uncle Vernon:
Fine day Sunday. In my opinion, best day of the week. Why is that, Dudley?

Harry:
[when Dudley doesn't answer] Because there's no post on Sundays?

Uncle Vernon:
Right you are, Harry! No post on Sundays. Hah!

Harry:
Who are you?

Hagrid:
Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts. Of course, you know all about Hogwarts.

Harry:
Sorry, no.

Hagrid:
No? Blimey, Harry, did you never wonder where yer parents learned it all?

Harry:
All what?

Hagrid:
Yer a wizard, Harry.

Harry:
I-- I'm a what?

Hagrid:
A wizard! And a thumpin' good 'un, I'll wager, once you've been trained up a bit.

Harry:
I think you've made a mistake. I mean, I... can't be a... a wizard. I mean, I'm... just... Harry. Just Harry.

Hagrid:
Well, Just Harry... did you ever make anything happen? Anything you couldn't explain when you were angry or scared?

Harry:
[to the Dursleys; angrily after Vernon refuses Harry's entrance to Hogwarts because they swore when the took him in to put a stop to all this rubbish] You knew! You knew all along and you never told me?!

Aunt Petunia:
[bitterly] Of course we knew! How could you not be? My perfect sister being what she was? My mother and father were so proud the day she got her letter. We have a witch in the family. Isn't it wonderful? I was the only one who saw her for what she was: a freak! And then she met that Potter, and she had you, and I knew you'd be the same. Just as strange, just as... abnormal. And then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you!

Harry:
Blown up?! You told me my parents died in a car crash!

Hagrid:
A CAR CRASH?! A car crash kill Lily an' James Potter?!

Aunt Petunia:
[sheepishly] We had to tell him something...

Hagrid:
It's an outrage! It's a scandal!

Uncle Vernon:
He will not be going!

Hagrid:
[somewhat amused] Oh, and I suppose a great Muggle like yourself's gonna stop him, are ya?

Harry:
Muggle?

Hagrid:
Err, non-magic folk. [to the Dursleys, angrily] This boy's had his name down ever since he was born! He's going to the finest school of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the world, and he'll be under the finest headmaster that Hogwarts has ever seen: Albus Dumbledore. [In the meantime, Hagrid is unaware of Dudley stealing the cake he made for Harry]

Uncle Vernon:
I will not pay to have some crackpot old fool teach him magic tricks!

[Visibly angered, Hagrid whips out his umbrella and points it threateningly at Uncle Vernon.]

Hagrid:
Never. Insult. Albus Dumbledore. In front of me.

[Hagrid sees Dudley eating Harry's cake and points his umbrella at him. A Pig's tail appears on his backside. The Dursley scream and run out of the room]

Ollivander:
Curious.... Very curious...

Harry:
Sorry...but what's curious?

Ollivander:
I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr Potter. Every single wand. And it just so happens that the phoenix, whose tail feather resides in your wand, gave another feather. Just one other. It is curious that you should be destined for this wand, when its brother gave you that scar.

Harry:
....And who owned that wand?

Ollivander:
We do not speak his name. The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. It's not always clear why. But. I think it is clear that we can expect great things from you, Mr Potter. After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things also. Terrible, yes... but great.

Harry:
He killed my parents, didn't he? The one who gave me this. [points to his scar. Hagrid looks hesitant respond] You know, Hagrid, I know you do.

Hagrid:
[sighs and leans towards him] First - and understand this, Harry, 'cause it's very important - not all wizards are good. Some of them go bad. And a few years ago, there was one wizard who went as bad as you can go. And his name was V-- [becomes tense] His name was V--

Harry:
Maybe if you wrote it down?

Hagrid:
Nah, I can't spell it. All right... [in a whisper] Voldemort.

Harry:
Voldemort?

Hagrid:
[frantically] Shh! It was dark times, Harry, dark times.

[As Hagrid narrates, we see a flashback of a robed, hooded figure - Voldemort - breaking into Harry's parents' home and striking his mother dead; it ends just as Voldemort aims his wand at baby Harry]

Hagrid:
Voldemort started to gather some followers; brought 'em over to the dark side. Anyone that stood up to him ended up dead. Your parents fought against him, but nobody lived once he decided to kill 'em. Nobody. Not one. Except you.

Harry:
Me? Voldemort tried to kill... me?

Hagrid:
Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut on yer forehead. A mark like that only comes from bein' touched by a curse, and an evil curse at that.

Harry:
And what happened to Vol-- To You-Know-Who?

Hagrid:
Well, some say he died. Codswallop in my opinion. Nope, I reckon he's still out there somewhere, too tired to carry on. But one thing's fer certain: Somethin' about you stumped him that night. That's why you're famous. That's why everyone knows your name. You're the Boy Who Lived.

Hermione:
Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named Neville has lost one.

Ron:
No.

Hermione:
[sees Ron attempting magic] Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see then.

Ron:
Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow... turn this stupid, fat rat yellow!

[Nothing happens]

Hermione:
Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good is it? [Ron gives Harry an indignant and exasperated look] Of course, I've only tried a few simple ones myself, but they've all worked for me. For example, [sits in front of Harry] Oculus Reparo.

[She waves her wand and Harry's glasses are immediately fixed.]

Hermione:
That's better, isn't it? [realizes who he is] Holy cricket, you're Harry Potter! I'm Hermione Granger. [looks at Ron] And... you are?

Ron:
[muffled] Um, Ron Weasley.

Hermione:
Pleasure. You two best change into robes, I expect we'll be arriving soon. [leaves, but turns around to face Ron] You've got dirt on your nose, by the way. Did you know? Just there.

[Ron, annoyed, rubs his nose and finds she is right]

Draco Malfoy:
So it's true, then. What they're saying on the train. Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts. [All the first years murmur in excitement; Draco indicates two boys next to him] This is Crabbe, and Goyle. And I'm Malfoy. Draco Malfoy. [Ron snickers; Draco turns to glare at him] Think my name's funny, do you? Well, no need to ask yours. Red hair, and a hand-me-down-robe? You must be a Weasley. [turns back to Harry] You'll soon find out some wizarding families are better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there. [offers his hand]

Harry:
[coldly] I think I can tell the wrong sort for myself, thanks.

[Harry has just joined the Gryffindor Quidditch team.]

Ron:
Fred and George are on the team too. Beaters.

Fred:
Our job is to make sure that you don't get bloodied up too much! Can't make any promises. Rough game, Quidditch.

George:
Brutal! But no one's died in years. Someone will vanish occasionally (Harry and Ron walk off) but they'll turn up in a month or two!

Oliver:
(Leading Harry to practice, carrying a trunk) Quidditch is easy enough to understand. Each team has seven players: Three Chasers, two Beaters, one Keeper, and a Seeker. That's you. (Opens trunk and takes a round ball with four indents in it out) There are three kinds of balls. (Tosses it to Harry) This one's called the Quaffle. The Chasers handle the Quaffle and try to put it through one of those three hoops. (Points to three hoops on opposite end of field.) The Keeper, that's me, defends the hoops. With me so far?

Harry:
I think so. (Tosses Quaffle back to Oliver) What are those? (Acknowledges two other balls)

Oliver:
Oh. (Takes out a bat, a little shorter that a baseball bat) You better take this. (Hands bat to Harry, then unlatches one of the balls from trunk. It shoots up into the air, then zooms back down) Careful now, it's comin' back.

(Harry whacks the ball with the bat. The ball zooms off in another direction)

Oliver:
Not bad, Potter. You'd make a fair Beater. (The ball comes back heading directly for Oliver) Uh-oh. (It whacks him in the chest, knocking him over. He fights with it to get it back in the trunk. He eventually succeeds, and locks it back in)

Harry:
What was that thing?

Oliver:
(Panting) Bludger. Nasty little buggers. But you... (Points to Harry)...are a Seeker. (Takes out walnut-sized gold ball with silver wings) The only thing I want you to worry about is this. The Golden Snitch. (Hands it to Harry)

Harry:
I like this ball.

Oliver:
Ah, you like it now. Just wait. It's wicked fast and damn near impossible to see.

Harry:
What do I do with it?

Oliver:
You catch it... before the other team's Seeker. You catch this, the game's over. You catch this, Potter, and we win.

Hagrid:
Ron, Hermione, you'll come with me.

Ron:
(In a timid, high voice) Okay.

Hagrid:
And Harry, you'll go with Malfoy.

[Harry nods]

Malfoy:
Alright, then I get Fang.

Hagrid:
Fine. Just so you know, he's a bloody coward.

(Malfoy and Harry look over at Fang, who whimpers)

[Harry enters a dungeon and discovers Quirrell in front of the Mirror of Erised]

Harry:
You?! No, it can't-- it can't be! Snape, he was-- he was the one who--

Quirrell:
Yes, Snape. He does seem the type, doesn't he? Next to him, who would suspect p-p-p-poor st-st-st-stuttering Professor Quirrell?

Harry:
But that day, during the Quidditch match, Snape tried to kill me.

Quirrell:
No, dear boy. I tried to kill you! And trust me, if Snape's cloak hadn't caught fire and broken my eye contact, I would have succeeded! Even with Snape muttering his little counter-curse.

Harry:
Snape was... trying to save me?

Quirrell:
I knew you were a danger to me right from the off. Especially after Halloween.

Harry:
Th-th-then you let the troll in!

Quirrell:
Very good, Potter, yes. Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled. While everyone else was running about the dungeons, he went to the third floor to head me off. He, of course, never trusted me again. He barely left me alone. But he doesn't understand - I'm never alone. Never. Now, what does this mirror do? Yes, I see what I desire. I see myself holding the stone. But how do I get it?!

Creepy Voice:
Use the boy.

Quirrell:
Come here, Potter! NOW!

[Harry walks to Quirrell and the Mirror of Erised]

Quirrell:
Now... tell me. What do you see?

[Harry sees his reflection take out the Philosopher's Stone, then places it into his pocket. He realizes that it actually is in his pocket.]

Quirrell:
What is it, what do you see?!

Harry:
I-- I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore. I've won the House Cup.

Creepy Voice:
He lies.

Quirrell:
Tell the truth! What do you see?!

Creepy Voice:
Let me speak to him.

Quirrell:
Master, you are not strong enough!

Creepy Voice:
I have strength enough for this...

[Quirrell unwraps his turban, revealing a hideous face on the back of his head - Voldemort.]

Voldemort:
Harry Potter. We meet again.

Harry:
Voldemort?

Voldemort:
Yes. You see what I've become? See what I must do to survive? Live off another, a mere parasite. Unicorn blood can sustain me, but it cannot give me a body of my own. But there is something that can. Something that, conviently enough, lies in your pocket!

[Harry attempts to escape]

Voldemort:
Stop him!

[Quirrell blocks Harry by snapping his fingers, causing a large fire to block off the entrance]

Voldemort:
Don't be a fool. Why suffer a horrific death, when you can join me and live?

Harry:
Never!

Voldemort:
[laughs] Bravery. Your parents had it too. Tell me, Harry... would you like to see your mother and father again? [Harry's parents appear in the Mirror of Erised] Together, we can bring them back. All I ask is for something in return.

[Harry pulls the Stone out of his pocket.]

Voldemort:
That's it, Harry. There is no good and evil. There is only power... and those too weak to seek it. Together, we'll do extraordinary things. Just give me the Stone.

[Harry's parents disappear from the mirror]

Harry:
[screams] You liar!

Voldemort:
Kill him!

[Quirrell flies into the air and begins choking Harry. Harry tries to reach for the stone, but grabs Quirrell's wrist, and suddenly makes it immediately begin to burn and turn into ash. Quirrell gasps, screams, and lets go of Harry in fear]

Quirrell:
[panicking] What is this magic?!

Voldemort:
Fool! Get the Stone!

[Quirrell reaches for the Stone with his other hand. Harry puts his hands on Quirrell's face, causing his face to burn and turn to ash too. Quirrell screams in agony, and turns to ash, until there is nothing but his robes. Harry grabs the Stone. Behind him the ghost of Voldemort rushes at Harry, knocks him out and escapes while the camera pans towards the Stone.]

[Last lines]

Hermione:
Feels strange to be going home, doesn't it?

Harry:
I'm not going home... not really.

Let The Magic Begin.

Journey Beyond Your Imagination.

Dudley:
[about his gifts] How many are there?

Uncle Vernon:
36, counted them myself.

Dudley:
36?! But last year, last year I had 37!

Uncle Vernon:
I mean– Yes, yes. Well, some are a quite a bit bigger than last year's –

Dudley:
I don't care how big they are!

[After their fiasco with a three-headed dog.]

Ron:
What do they think they're doing? Keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?

Hermione:
You don't use your eyes, do you? Didn't you see what it was standing on?

Ron:
I wasn't looking at its feet! I was a bit preoccupied with its heads. Or maybe you didn't notice. They were three!

Hermione:
It was standing on a trapdoor. Which means, it wasn't there by accident. It's guarding something.

Harry:
Guarding something?

Hermione:
That's right. Now, if you two don't mind, I'm going to bed before either of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed. Or worse, expelled. [Goes into her dormitory]

Ron:
She needs to sort out her priorities.

[Talking about Snape after the Quidditch match when he was accused of jinxing Harry's broom]

Hagrid:
Nonsense! Why would Snape put a curse on Harry's broom?

Harry:
Who knows? Why was he trying to get past that three-headed dog on Hallowe'en?

Hagrid:
Who told you about Fluffy?

Ron:
Fluffy?!

Hermione:
That thing has a name?

Hagrid:
Of course, he's got a name! He's mine! I bought him off an Irish feller I met down at the pub last year. The I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the–

Harry:
Yes?

Hagrid:
Shouldn't have said that. No more questions! Don't ask any more questions. That's top-secret, that is.

Harry:
But, Hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding, Snape's trying to steal it.

Hagrid:
Codswallop! Professor Snape is a Hogwarts teacher!

Hermione:
Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a spell when I see one. I've read all about them. You've got to keep eye contact and Snape wasn't blinking.

Harry:
Exactly.

[Snape has approached Harry, Ron and Hermione]

Snape:
Now, what would three young Gryffindors such as yourselves be doing inside on a day like this?

Hermione:
We... [Snape looks to her, expecting an answer]...we were just...

Snape:
You ought to be more careful. People may think you're...[Snape notices Harry eyeing him cautiously. He glares sharply at Harry]...up to something.

Dumbledore:
Harry, do you know why Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him? [Harry shakes his head] It was because of your mother. She sacrificed herself for you, and that kind of act leaves a mark. [Harry reaches up to touch his scar] No, no. This kind of mark cannot be seen. It lives in your very skin.

Harry:
What is it?

Dumbledore:
[smiling] Love, Harry. Love.

Scared Pottah

Draco Malfoy:
Potter, Potter. Is it true you fainted( goyle pretend faints) I mean you actually fainted.

Ron:
shove off Malfoy.

Harry:
You think I'm not listening too? You think I don't know how it feels?

Ron:
No you don't know how it feels! Your parents are dead! You have no family.

Aunt Petunia:
Up! Get up! Now!

Dudley:
Wake up, cousin! We're going to the zoo!

Aunt Petunia:
Here he comes the birthday boy!

Uncle Vernon:
Happy birthday son.

Aunt Petunia:
Why don't you just cook the breakfast and try not to burn anything.

Harry:
Yes Aunt Petunia.

Aunt Petunia:
I want everything to be perfect for my Dudley's special day!

Uncle Vernon:
Hurry up! Bring my coffee boy!

Harry:
Yes Uncle Vernon.

Aunt Petunia:
Aren't they wonderful darling?

Dudley:
[about his gifts] How many are there?

Uncle Vernon:
36, counted them myself.

Dudley:
36?! But last year, last year I had 37!

Uncle Vernon:
I mean– Yes, yes. Well, some are a quite a bit bigger than last year's –

Dudley:
I don't care how big they are!

Uncle Vernon:
Now, now, now, this is what we're going to do. Is that when we go out we're going to buy you 2 new presents. How's that pumpkin?

Aunt Petunia:
It should be a lovely day at the zoo. I'm really looking forward to it.

Uncle Vernon:
I'm warning you now boy. Any funny business, any at all and you won't have any meals for a week. Get in.

[Dudley and Vernon are banging on the glass at a snake habitat at the zoo]

Dudley:
Make it move.

Uncle Vernon:
Move.

Dudley:
Move!!

Harry:
He's asleep!

Dudley:
He's boring.

Harry:
Sorry about him he doesn't understand what it's like, lying there day after day watching people press their ugly faces in on you. [the snake looks straight at Harry] Can you hear me? [the snake nods] It's just I've never talked to a snake before. Do you… Do you talk to people often? You're from Burma, aren't you? Was it nice there? Did you miss your family? [the snake shakes its head no] I see. That's me as well. I never knew my parents either.

Dudley:
[rushing over and shoving Harry out of the way] Mummy, Dad, come here; you won't believe what this snake is doing! [the entire pane of glass vanishes; Dudley stumbles and falls in] Woah! Woah! Ah!

[The snake slithers out and looks at Harry]

Snake:
Thanks.

Harry:
Any time.

[The snake makes its escape, heading for the door]

Crowd:
Snake! Ahh!

[Dudley gets up, but panics when he finds the glass has reappeared]

Dudley:
Mum! Mummy! Help me!

Aunt Petunia:
My darling boy! How did you get in there! Who did this? How did you get in there? Is there a snake?

Uncle Vernon:
Oh Marge is ill. Ate a funny whelk.

Dudley:
Dad! Look! Harry's got a letter!

Harry:
Hey give it back! It's mine!

Uncle Vernon:
Yours? Who'd be writing to you?

Uncle Vernon:
Fine day Sunday. In my opinion, best day of the week. Why is that, Dudley?

Harry:
[when Dudley doesn't answer] Because there’s no post on Sundays?

Uncle Vernon:
Right you are, Harry! [takes cookie from Harry] No post on Sundays. Hah! No blasted letters today! No, sir! Not one single bloody letter! Not one! No sir, not one blasted, miserable- -

Dudley:
Make it stop, please!

Uncle Vernon:
Stop it!

Dudley:
Mummy what's happening?

Uncle Vernon:
Give me that! Give me that letter!

Harry:
Get off! They're my letters! Let go of me!

Uncle Vernon:
That's it! We're going away, far away! Where they can't find us!

Dudley:
Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?!

Harry:
All students must be equipped with a one standard size two pewter cauldron, and may bring, if they desire, either an owl, a cat, or a toad. Can we find all this in London?

Hagrid:
If you know where to go.

[Harry and Ron run into McGonagall's classroom.]

Ron:
Made it! Can you imagine the look on old McGonagall's face if we were late?

[The cat leaps from the table and turns into McGonagall, who goes over to Harry and Ron.]

Ron:
That was bloody brilliant!

McGonagall:
Oh, thank you for that assessment, Mr. Weasley. Perhaps it would be more useful if I were to transfigure Mr. Potter and yourself into a pocket watch? That way, one of you might be on time.

Harry:
We got lost.

McGonagall:
Then perhaps a map? I trust you don't need one to find your seats.

[As McGonagall goes over to her table, Harry and Ron sit next to each other.]

Firenze Harry Potter, you must leave. You are known to many creatures here. The Forest is not safe at this time, especially for you.

Harry:
But what was that thing you saved me from?

Firenze:
A monstrous creature. [indicates the dead Unicorn] It is a terrible crime to slay a Unicorn. Drinking a Unicorn's blood will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price, for you have slain something so pure, that from the moment the blood touches your lips, you will have a half-life. A cursed life.

Harry:
But who would choose such a life?

Firenze:
Can you think of no one?

Harry:
Do you mean to say, that-that thing that killed the Unicorn, that was drinking its blood... that was Voldemort?

Firenze:
Do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment, Mr. Potter?

Harry:
The Sorcerer's Stone.

[Hagrid, Ron and Hermione appear]

Hermione:
Harry!

Hagrid:
Hello there, Firenze. See you've met our young Mr. Potter. You alright there, Harry?

Harry:
[nods] Mm-hm.

Firenze:
Harry Potter, this is where I leave you. You're safe now. Good luck.

[Harry wakes up in the hospital wing, puts on his glasses, and smiled to see his presents on the table]

Dumbledore:
Good afternoon, Harry. [sees candies and cards on table] Ah, tokens from your admirers.

Harry:
Admirers?

Dumbledore:
What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret. So, naturally, the whole school knows. Ah, I see your friend Ronald has saved you the trouble of opening your Chocolate Frogs.

Harry:
Ron was here? Is he alright? What about Hermione?

Dumbledore:
Fine. They're both just fine.

Harry:
But what happened to the Stone?

Dumbledore:
Relax, dear boy. The Stone has been destroyed. My friend Nicholas and I have had a little chat, and agreed it was best, all around.

Harry:
But, then Flamel... he'll die, won't he?

Dumbledore:
He has enough elixir to set his affairs in order. But yes, he will die.

Harry:
How is it I got the Stone, Sir? One minute I was standing in the Mirror, and the next...

Dumbledore:
Ah, you see, only a person who wanted to find the Stone, find it, but not use it, would be able to get it. That is one of my more brilliant ideas. And between you and me, that is saying something.

Harry:
Does that mean, with the Stone gone that is, that Voldemort can never come back?

Dumbledore:
Ah, I'm afraid... there are ways in which he can return. Harry, do you know why Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him? [Harry shakes his head] It was because of your mother. She sacrificed herself for you, and that kind of act leaves a mark. [Harry reaches up to touch his scar] No, no. This kind of mark cannot be seen. It lives in your very skin.

Harry:
What is it?

Dumbledore:
[smiling] Love, Harry. Love. [walks back to the table] Ah, Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans. [picks it up] I was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit-flavored one, and since then I'm afraid I've lost my liking for them. But, I think I could be safe with a nice toffee. [eats one bean] Mm, alas. Earwax.

[Harry smiles]

Harry Potter:
[to DA in Hog's Head] Facing this stuff in real life is not like school. In school, if you make a mistake, you can just try again tomorrow, but out there, when you're a second away from being murdered or watching a friend die right before your eyes, you don't know what that's like.

Harry Potter:
[Addressing Dumbledore's Army] Working hard is important. But there is something that matters even more, believing in yourself. Think of it this way; every great wizard in history has started out as nothing more than what we are now, students. If they can do it, why not us?

Dolores Umbridge:
You know, I really hate children!

Dolores Umbridge:
[As she is carried into the forest by the centaurs] I am Senior Undersecretary Dolores Jane Umbridge. Let me go!

Dolores Umbridge:
As I have told you before, Mr. Potter, naughty children deserve to be punished.

Dolores Umbridge:
I will have order!

Luna Lovegood:
[to Harry] Well if I were You-Know-Who, I'd want you to feel cut off from everyone else; because if it's just you alone, you're not as much of a threat.

Luna Lovegood:
[to Harry, about the Thestrals] You're not going mad. [Lowering her upside-down magazine] I can see them too. You're just as sane as I am.

Luna Lovegood:
[to Harry RE the rumours in the Daily Prophet] We both believe you by the way. (pause; in one breath) That He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back and that you fought him and that the Ministry and the Prophet are conspiring against you and Dumbledore.

Cornelius Fudge:
We have confirmed, that ten high-security prisoners, in the early hours of yesterday evening, did escape. And of course the Muggle Prime Minister has been alerted to the danger. We strongly suspect that the break out was engineered by a man with personal experience in escaping from Azkaban, notorious mass-murderer Sirius Black, cousin of escapee, Bellatrix Lestrange.

Cornelius Fudge:
Having already revolutionized the teaching of Defense Against the Dark Arts, Dolores Umbridge will, as High Inquisitor, have powers, to address the seriously falling standards, at Hogwarts School.

Cornelius Fudge:
Security will remain the Ministry's top priority.

Uncle Vernon:
[In response to a howler convicting Harry of Underage Wizardry] JUSTICE.

Rubeus Hagrid:
It's changing out there. There's a storm coming, Harry... just like last time.

Sybill Trelawney:
(goes into a trance, makes a prediction) The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches... and the Dark Lord shall mark him as his equal but he shall have power the Dark Lord knows not... For neither can live while the other s-survives.

Ronald Weasley:
[repeated line] Bloody hell...

Seamus Finnigan:
Harry! [Harry turns around] Well, I...er...I...um...Well, what I'm really trying to say is, I believe you. [Harry, Ron and Hermione stare at him in disbelief]

Molly Weasley:
OH! Just because you're allowed to use magic now does NOT mean you have to whip your wands out for EVERYTHING!!!!! Are you hungry, Harry?

Sirius Black:
[Last words; After Harry attacks Lucius Malfoy] Nice one, James!

Harry:
Hey, Big D. Beat up another ten-year-old?

Dudley:
This one deserved it.

Harry:
Five against one. Very brave.

Dudley:
You're one to talk. Moaning in your sleep every night. At least I'm not afraid of my pillow. Don't kill Cedric! Who's Cedric? Your boyfriend?

Harry:
Shut up.

Dudley:
He's going to kill me, Mum! Where is your mum, Potter? She dead? Is she dead? Is she dead, Potter? [Harry walks straight up to Dudley and forces his wand into his throat. The weather begins to change.] What are you doing?!

Harry:
I'm not doing anything!

Harry:
Where are we going? The letter said I had been expelled from Hogwarts.

Mad-Eye Moody:
Well you haven't been. Not yet. [to Kingsley] Kingsley, you take point.

(Kingsley steps forward)

Harry:
But the letter said--

Kingsley Shacklebolt:
[Interrupting Harry] Dumbledore has persuaded the Minister to suspend your expulsion pending a formal hearing.

Harry:
A hearing?

Kingsley Shacklebolt:
Uh-huh.

Nymphadora Tonks:
Don't worry Harry, we'll explain everything when we get back to headquarters.

Mad-Eye Moody:
Ssht! Not here, Nymphadora!

Nymphadora Tonks:
[Her hair turns red] Don't call me Nymphadora!

[Moody summons brooms with his wand]

Mad-Eye Moody:
Stay in formation everyone. Don't break ranks if one of us is killed!

[Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred and George are listening in on the Order's meeting]

Sirius:
If anyone has a right to know, it's Harry. If it wasn't for him, we wouldn't even know Voldemort was back. He's not a child, Molly!

Molly Weasley:
He's not a adult either. He's not James, Sirius.

Sirius Black:
He's not your son.

Molly Weasley:
He's as good as. Who else has he got?

[Ginny joins them]

Harry:
Hey, Ginny.

Sirius:
He's got me!

Snape:
How touching and paternal, Black. Perhaps Potter will grow up to be a felon, just like his godfather.

Sirius:
Now you stay out of this, Snivellus.

Harry:
Snape's part of the Order?

Ron:
Git.

Sirius:
I don't care what Dumbledore says about your supposed reformation. I know better.

Snape:
Why don't you tell him? Or are you afraid he won't take serious the word of a man hiding in his mother's house?

[Crookshanks starts to play with the Extendable Ear eventually pulling it loose]

Ron:
Hermione, I hate your cat.

Hermione:
Bad Crookshanks!

Arthur Weasley:
This is very, very peculiar. It seems that your hearing at the Minstry is to be before the entire Wizengamot.

Harry:
I don't understand, what's the Ministry of Magic got against me?

Moody:
Show him. He'll find out soon enough.

[Kingsley shows Harry a newspaper with the headline The Boy who Lies?]

Sirius:
He's been attacking Dumbledore as well. Fudge is using all his power, including his influence at the Daily Prophet, to smear anyone who claims the Dark Lord has returned.

Harry:
Why?

Lupin:
The Minister thinks Dumbledore's after his job.

Harry:
But that's insane. No one in their right mind could believe that Dumbledore--

Lupin:
Exactly the point. Fudge isn't in his right mind. It's been twisted and warped by fear. Now fear makes people do terrible things, Harry. The last time Voldemort gained power he almost destroyed everything we hold most dear. Now he's returned and I'm afraid the Minister will do almost anything to avoid facing that terrifying truth.

Sirius:
We think Voldemort wants to build up his army again. [Everyone turns to face Sirius] Fourteen years ago he had huge numbers at his command, not only witches and wizards but all sorts of dark creatures. He's been recruiting heavily and we've been attempting to do the same. But gathering followers isn't the only thing he's interested in. [Moody lets out a loud cough] We believe Voldemort may be after something else--

Moody:
Sirius--

Sirius:
Something he didn't have last time.

Harry:
You mean, a weapon?

[Sirius opens his mouth to speak]

Mrs. Weasley:
No! That's enough! He's just a boy! You tell him much more and you might as well induct him in the Order straight away.

Harry:
Good, I want to join. If Voldemort's raising an army, then I want to fight.

[At Harry's trial]

Dumbledore:
Witness for the defense, Albus Percival Wulfric... Brian... Dumbledore.

Fudge:
You, you got our message that the time and place of the hearing had been changed, did you?

Dumbledore:
I must have missed it. But by a happy mistake I arrived at the Ministry three hours early. [Pause] The charges?

Fudge:
The charges against the accused are as follows; that he did knowingly and in full awareness of the illegality of his actions, produced a Patronus charm in the presence of a Muggle. Do you deny producing said Patronus?

Harry:
No, I--

Fudge:
[Interrupting Harry] And you were aware that you were forbidden to use magic outside school while under the age of seventeen?

Harry:
Yes, but--

Cornelius Fudge:
Witches and wizards of the Wizengamot--

Harry:
I was only doing it because of the Dementors!

Amelia Bones:
Dementors? In Little Whinging?

Fudge:
That's quite clever. Muggles can't see Dementors, can they boy? Highly convenient.

Harry:
I'm not lying, there were two of them and if I hadn't--

Fudge:
[Interrupting Harry again] Enough! I'm sorry to interrupt what I'm sure would have been a very well rehearsed story, but since you can produce no witnesses of the event--

Dumbledore:
Pardon me Minister, but as it happens we can.

Amelia Bones:
Please describe the attack. What did they look like?

Mrs. Figg:
Well one of them was very large, and the other rather skinny.

Cornelius Fudge:
Not the boys, the Dementors.

Mrs. Figg:
Alright, right, well um, big. Cloaked. Then everything went cold, as though all the happiness had gone from the world.

Cornelius Fudge:
Now look here, Dementors don't just wander into a Muggle suburb and happen across a wizard, the odds are astronomical.

Dumbledore:
I don't think anyone would believe the Dementors were there by coincidence, Minister.

Umbridge:
Ahem. I'm sure I must have misunderstood you, Professor. Dementors are after all under the control of the Ministry of Magic. So silly of me but it sounded, for a moment, as though you were suggesting that the Ministry had ordered the attack on this boy.

Dumbldore:
That would be disturbing indeed, Madame Under-Secretary, which is why I'm sure the Ministry will be mounting a full-scale inquiry into why the two Dementors were so far away from Azkaban and why they mounted an attack without authorization. Of course, there is someone who might be behind the attack. Cornelius, I implore you to see reason. The evidence the Dark Lord's return is incontrovertible.

Fudge:
He's not back!

Dumbledore:
In the matter of Harry Potter, the law clearly states that magic may be used before Muggles in life-threatening situations.

Cornelius Fudge:
Laws can be changed if necessary, Dumbledore!

Dumbledore:
Clearly, it has become practice to hold a full criminal trial to deal with a simple matter of under-age magic.

Amelia Bones:
Those in favor of conviction?

[Fudge raises his hand followed by some other people including Umbridge]

Amelia Bones:
Those in favor of clearing the accused of all charges?

[Most people raise their hand, including Amelia Bones and Miss. Figg, who actually has no vote in this]

Cornelius Fudge:
[Reluctantly] Cleared of all charges!

Hermione:
Everyone this is Loony Love--Luna Lovegood. [Beat] What an interesting necklace.

Luna:
It's a charm actually. Keeps away the Nargles. [Pause] Hungry. I hope there's pudding.

[The carriage starts riding]

Ron:
[Whispering] What's a Nargle?

Hermione:
No idea.

Umbridge:
Thank you, Headmaster, for those kind words of welcome. And how lovely to see all your bright happy faces smiling up at me. [No one smiles] I'm sure we're all going to be very good friends.

Fred and George:
[sarcastically] That's likely.

Umbridge:
The Ministry of Magic has always considered the education of young witches and wizard of vital importance. Although each Headmaster has brought something new to this historic school... [Nods to Dumbledore] progress for the sake of progress must be discouraged. Let us preserve what must be preserved, perfect what can be perfected and prune practices that ought to be prohibited.

[Soft applause]

Dumbledore:
Thank you Professor Umbridge, that really was most illuminating.

Ron Weasley:
Illuminating? What a load of waffle!

Harry:
Dean, Seamus, good holiday?

Dean:
Alright, better than Seamus's anyway.

Seamus:
My mum didn't want me to come back this year.

Harry:
Why not?

Seamus:
Let me see, because of you! The Daily Prophet's been saying a lot of things about you Harry. And about Dumbledore as well.

Harry:
And your mum believes them?

Seamus:
Well, nobody was there the night Cedric died.

Harry:
[increasingly angry] Oh well, I guess you should read the Prophet. Then like your stupid mother, it'll tell you everything you need to know!

Seamus:
Don't you dare talk about my mother like that!

Harry:
I'll have a go at anyone that calls me a liar!

Ron:
[Entering the common room] What's going on?

Seamus:
He's mad, is what's going on! Do you believe the rubbish he's coming out with about You-Know-Who?

Ron:
Yeah, I do. Has anyone else got a problem with Harry?

Ron:
You alright, mate?

Harry:
I'm fine.

Ron:
Seamus was bang out of order. But he'll come through. You'll see--

Harry:
I said I'm fine Ron!

Ron:
[taken aback] Right. I'll just leave you to your thoughts then. [Leaves the dormitory]

Umbridge:
Your previous instruction for this subject has been disturbingly uneven. But you will be pleased to know, from now on you will be following a carefully structured, Ministry-approved course of defensive magic. [Hermione raises her hand] Yes?

Hermione:
There's nothing in here about using defensive spells?

Umbridge:
Using spells? [laughs] Why I can't imagine why you would need to use spells in my classroom.

Ron:
We're not gonna use magic?

Umbridge:
You'll be learning about defensive spells, in a secure risk-free way.

Harry:
Well, what use is that? If we're gonna be attacked, it won't be risk-free.

Umbridge:
Students will raise their hands when they speak in my class. It is the view of the Ministry that a theoretical knowledge will be sufficient to get you through your examinations, which after all is what school is all about!

Harry:
And how is theory supposed to prepare us for what's out there?

Umbridge:
There is nothing out there, dear. Who would you imagine would want to attack children like yourself?

Harry:
Oh, I don't know, maybe Lord Voldemort?

[Silence]

Umbridge:
Now let me make this quite plain. You have been told that a certain Dark Wizard is at large once again. This... is... a... lie!

Harry:
It's not a lie, I saw him! I fought him!

Umbridge:
Detention, Mr. Potter!

Harry:
So according to you Cedric Diggory dropped dead of his own accord?

Umbridge:
Cedric Diggory's death was a tragic accident.

Harry:
It was murder. Voldemort killed him. You must know this--

Umbridge:
Enough! Enough.

Umbridge:
Pardon me, professor, but what exactly are you insinuating?

Professor McGonnagall:
I am merely requesting that when it comes to my students, you conform to the prescribed disciplinary practices.

Umbridge:
So silly of me but it sounds as if you're questioning my authority in my own classroom... [Takes a step up] Minerva.

Professor McGonnagall:
Not at all, [Does the same] Dolores. Merely your medieval methods.

Umbridge:
I am sorry dear, but to question my practices is to question the Ministry and, by extension, the Minister, [whispers] himself. I am a tolerant woman but the one thing I will not stand for is disloyalty.

Professor McGonnagall:
[Takes a step down] Disloyalty?

Umbridge:
Things at Hogwarts are far worse than I feared. Cornelius will want to take immediate action.

Umbridge:
You applied first for the Defense Against the Dark Arts post, is that correct?

Snape:
...Yes.

Umbridge:
But you were unsuccessful?

Snape:
...Obviously.

[Ron snickers just as Umbridge leaves. Snape whacks him over the head with a book.]

[The students are watching Umbridge fire Trelawney]

Sybil Trelawney:
[in tears] Sixteen years I've lived and taught here! Hogwarts is my home! You can't do this!

Dolores Umbridge:
[shows the Order of Dismissal to Trelawney] Actually, I can. [McGonagall arrives and tries to comfort Trelawney] [to McGonagall] Something you'd like to say, dear?

Minerva McGonagall:
Oh, there are several things I would like to say!

Albus Dumbledore:
[arrives furiously] Professor McGonagall, might I ask you to escort Sybil back inside?!

Minerva Mcgonagall:
[to Trelawney] Sybil, dear, this way.

Sybil Trelawney:
[shakes Dumbledore's hand] Oh, thank you! Thank you!

Dolores Umbridge:
Dumbledore, may I remind you that under the terms of Educational Decree #23, as enacted by the Minister...

Albus Dumbledore:
You have the right to dismiss my teachers. You do not, however, have the authority to banish them from the grounds! That power remains with the headmaster!

Dolores Umbridge:
For now.

Albus Dumbledore:
[turns around to the students] Don't you all have studying to do?

Harry:
First we need to find a place to practice where Umbridge won't find out.

Ginny:
The Shrieking Shack?

Harry:
It's too small.

Hermione:
Forbidden Forest?

Ron:
Not bloody likely!

Ginny:
Harry? What happens if Umbridge does find out?

Hermione:
Who cares? I mean, sort of exciting, isn't it, breaking the rules?

Ron:
[pleasantly surprised] Who are you, and what have you done with Hermione Granger?

Hermione:
You've done it, Neville. You found the Room of Requirement.

Ron:
The what?

Hermione:
It's also known as the Come-And-Go Room. The Room of Requirement only appears when a person has real need of it, and is always equipped for the seeker's needs.

Ron:
So, say you really needed the toilet...?

Hermione:
Yes, that's the idea.

Harry:
It's brilliant! It's like Hogwarts wants us to fight back.

Umbridge:
You will please copy the approved text four times to ensure maximum pretention. There will be no need to talk.

Hermione:
[sotto voice] No need to think is more like it.

[Neville flicks out wand]

Neville:
[whispers] Expelliarmus.

Umbridge:
Wands away.

Harry:
Are you alright? I heard Umbridge gave you a rough time the other day.

Cho:
Yeah I'm okay. Anyway, it's worth it. It's just, just learning all this. Makes me wonder whether if he'd known it...

Harry:
Cedric, Cedric did know this stuff. He was really good. It's just, Voldemort was better.

Cho:
You're a really good teacher, Harry. I've never been able to stun anything before. [Mistletoe magically appears above Cho and Harry] Mistletoe.

Harry:
Probably full of Nargles, though.

Cho:
What are Nargles?

Harry:
I have no idea.

[They kiss]

Hermione:
[referring to Harry's kiss] Well, how was it?

Harry:
Wet. Well, she was sort of... crying.

Ron:
That bad at it, are you?

Hermione:
I'm sure Harry's kissing is more than satisfactory. Cho spends half her time crying these days.

Ron:
Think a bit of snogging would cheer her up.

Hermione:
Don't you understand how she must be feeling? [Ron and Harry just stare at her] Well, obviously she's feeling sad about Cedric, and therefore confused about liking Harry and guilty about kissing him. Conflicted because Umbridge is threatening to sack her mother from her job at the Ministry and frightened of failing her O.W.L.'s because she's so busy worrying about everything else.

Ron:
One person couldn't feel all that. They'd explode!

Hermione:
Just because you've got the emotional range of a teaspoon!

[Harry's describing his nightmare. Dumbledore is talking to Harry with his back turned.]

Dumbledore:
In the dream were you standing next to the victim, or looking down at the scene?

Harry:
Neither, I--It was like I--Professor, will you please just tell me what's happening?

Dumbledore:
Everard! Arthur is on guard duty tonight. Make sure he's found by the right people.

Harry:
Sir...

Dumbledore:
Phineas! You must go to your portrait at Grimmauld Place. Tell them that Arthur Weasley is gravely injured and his children will be arriving there soon, by Portkey.

Everard:
They got him, Albus. It was close but they think he'll make it. Once more the Dark Lord failed to acquire it.

Dumbledore:
Oh, thank goodness! Next we need to--

Harry:
[enraged] LOOK AT ME! [Dumbledore finally faces Harry] What's happening to me?

Snape:
[Entering Dumbledore's office] You wished to see me, Headmaster?

Dumbledore:
Oh Severus. I'm afraid we can't wait. Not even till the morning. Otherwise we'll all be vulnerable.

Snape:
It appears there is a connection between the Dark Lord's mind and your own. Whether he is, as yet, aware of this connection is for the moment unclear. Pray he remains ignorant.

Harry:
You mean if he knows about it then, he'll be able to read my mind?

Snape:
Read it, control it, unhinge it. In the past it was often the Dark Lord's pleasure to invade the minds of his victims, creating visions designed to torture them into madness. Only after extracting the last exquisite ounce of agony, only when he had them literally begging for death would he finally kill them. Used properly, the power of Occlumency will help shield you from access or influence. In these lessons I will attempt to penetrate your mind. You will attempt to resist. Prepare yourself! Legilimens! [Series of flashbacks] Concentrate, Potter. Focus.

Harry:
[to Sirius] This connection between me and Voldemort, what if the reason for it is that I'm becoming more like him? [starts to choke up; fighting back tears] I just feel so... angry, all the time. And what if after everything I've been through, something's gone wrong inside me. What if I'm becoming bad?

Sirius:
I want you to listen to me very carefully, Harry. You're not a bad person. You're a very good person, who bad things have happened to. You understand? [Harry nods] Besides, the world isn't split into good people and Death Eaters. We have all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the power we choose to act on. That's who we really are.

Hagrid:
Dumbledore sent me to parley with the giants.

Hermione:
The giants?! You found them?

Hagrid:
Well, they're not that hard to find, to be perfectly honest. They're so big, you see.

Neville Longbottom:
[talking to Harry alone] Fourteen years ago, a Death Eater named Bellatrix Lestrange used the Cruciatus Curse on my parents. She tortured them for information, but they never gave in. I'm quite proud to be their son. But I'm not sure I'm ready for everyone to know just yet.

Harry Potter:
We're gonna make them proud, Neville. That's a promise.

Umbridge:
I've been watching them for weeks and see, Dumbledore's army. Proof of what I've been telling you right from the beginning, Cornelius. [to Dumbledore] All your fear mongering about You-Know-Who never fooled us for a minute. We see your lies for what they were, a smokescreen for your bid to seize control of the Ministry.

Dumbledore:
Naturally.

Harry:
No, professor! He had nothing to do with it, it was me!

Dumbledore:
Most noble of you Harry to shield me, but as it's been pointed out the parchment clearly says Dumbledore's Army, not Potter's. I instructed Harry to form this organization and I, and I alone, am responsible for its activities.

Cornelius Fudge:
Dispatch a owl to the Daily Prophet. If we hurry we can still make the front page. Dawlish, Shacklebolt! You will escort Dumbledore to Azkaban, to await trial for conspiracy and sedition...

Dumbledore:
Ah, I thought we might hit this little snag. You seem to be laboring under the delusion I am going to - what was the phrase? Come quietly. Well I can tell you this: I have no intention of going to Azkaban.

Umbridge:
Enough of this! Take him!

[Dumbledore summons his phoenix Fawkes and both explode and disappear in a ball of a flame.]

Kingsley Shacklebolt:
Uh, you may not like him, Minister, but you can't deny--Dumbledore's got style!

[Snape has just witnessed Harry's memory of seeing his parents in the Mirror of Erised.]

Snape:
Feeling sentimental?

Harry:
That's private.

Snape:
Not to me. And not to the Dark Lord if you don't improve. Every memory he has access to is a weapon he can use against you. You won't last two seconds if he invades your mind. You're just like your father. Lazy, arrogant.

Harry:
Don't say a word against my father.

Snape:
Weak!

Harry:
I'm not weak!

Snape:
Then prove it! Control your emotions! Discipline your mind! Legilimens!

[Series of flashbacks, including a touching moment between Harry and Sirius.]

Harry (In Memory):
Sirius.

Snape:
I may vomit.

Harry:
Stop it!

Snape:
Is that what you call control?

Harry:
[heavy panting] We've been at it for hours. If I could just rest!

Snape:
The Dark Lord isn't resting. You and Black, you're two of a kind, sentimental children forever whining about how bitterly unfair your lives have been. Well, it may have escaped your notice, but life isn't fair. Your blessed father knew that, in fact he frequently saw to it!

Harry:
My father was a great man!

Snape:
Your father was a swine. Legilimens!

Harry:
Protego!

(The Marauders approach Severus Snape)

James Prongs Potter:
Come on, Moony! Padfoot! Snape! (points his wand at Snape) Expelliarmus!

Sirius Padfoot Black III:
Nice one, James!

Harry Potter:
(shocked) Dad?

James Prongs Potter:
Impedimenta!

(Hogwartians start to chant Snivellus! Greasy! Snivellus! Greasy!)

James Prongs Potter :
[smirks] Right, who wants to see me take off Snivelly's trousers?

'(Back in Snape's office)

[He blocks Harry out of the memory.]

Snape:
Enough. [grabs Harry by his shirt] Your lessons are at an end.

Harry:
I didn't mean--

Snape:
Get. Out.

Voldemort:
I need that prophecy.

Sirius:
You'll have to kill me.

Voldemort:
Oh I will, but first you will fetch it for me. Crucio! Crucio!

Harry:
Alert the Order if you can.

Ron:
Are you mental? We're going with you!

Harry:
It's too dangerous.

Hermione:
When are you going to get it into your head?! We're in this together!

Umbridge:
[Catching them] That you are!

Snape:
You sent for me, Headmistress?

Umbridge:
Snape, yes. The time has come for answers, whether they want to give them to me or not. Have you brought the Veritaserum?

Snape:
I'm afraid you used up all my stores, interrogating students. The last of it on Miss Chang. Unless you wish to poison him - and I assure you I would have the greatest sympathy if you did - I cannot help you. [turns to leave]

Harry:
[to Snape; desperately] He's got Padfoot. He's got Padfoot at the place where it's hidden.

Umbridge:
Padfoot? What is Padfoot? Where what is hidden? What is he talking about Snape?

[Pause for effect]

Snape:
No idea. [leaves without another word]

Umbridge:
Very well. You give me no choice, Potter. As this is a matter of Ministry Security, you leave me with... no other alternative. The Cruiciatus Curse ought to loosen your tongue.

Hermione:
That's illegal.

Umbridge:
[Putting a picture of Minister Fudge face down] What Cornelius doesn't know won't hurt him. [prepares to curse Harry]

Hermione:
Tell her, Harry!

Umbridge:
Tell me what?

Hermione:
Well, if you won't tell her where it is, I will.

Umbridge:
Where what is?

Hermione:
Dumbledore's secret weapon.

[In the Forbidden Forest]

Umbridge:
You have no business here, centaur. This is a Ministry matter. [A centaur takes out an arrow and places in on his bow] Lower your weapons. I warn you! Under the law, as creatures of near-human intelligence-- [The centaur fires its arrow] Protego! [makes a shield and the arrow falls on the ground] How dare you! Filthy halfbreed! Incarcerous!

[She casts a spell causing a centaur to be wrapped in a rope and fall to the ground. Hermione tries to free the centaur but is unable to.]

Hermione:
Please, please stop it! Please!

Umbridge:
No, enough! I will have order!

[Umbridge is picked up by Grawp. The centaurs charge.]

Umbridge:
[To Grawp] You animals! Do you know who I am?!!

Hermione:
[To the centaurs] It's not his fault, he doesn't understand!

[Grawp gets hit by an arrow and drops Umbridge. The centaurs pick her up.]

Umbridge:
Potter, do something! Tell them I mean no harm!

Harry:
I'm sorry, Professor. I must not tell lies.

Hermione:
[Running up with Harry to meet Ginny, Ron, Neville and Luna] How did you get away?

Ginny:
Puking Pastilles, it wasn't pretty.

Ron:
I told them I was hungry and wanted some sweets. Of course they told me to bugger off and ate the lot themselves.

Hermione:
[surprised] That was clever, Ron!

Ron:
[smiles] It's been known to happen.

Neville:
It was brilliant. So, how are we geting to London?

Harry:
Look, it's not that I don't appreciate everything you've done, all of you. But, I've got you into enough trouble as it is.

Neville:
Dumbledore's Army was supposed to be about doing something real. Or was all that just words to you?

Ron:
Maybe you don't have to do this all by yourself, mate.

Harry:
So, how are we going to get to London?

Luna:
We fly, of course.

Harry:
Where's Sirius?

Lucius Malfoy:
You know, you really should learn to tell the difference between dreams and reality. You only saw what the Dark Lord wanted you to see. Now hand me the prophecy.

Harry:
You do anything to us and I'll break it.

Bellatrix Lestrange:
[laughs] He knows how to play! Itty, bitty, baby, Potter!

Bellatrix Lestrange:
Neville Longbottom is it? How's mum and dad?

Neville:
Better [points wand] now they're about to be avenged.

Lucius Malfoy:
All we want is that prophecy.

Harry:
Why did Voldemort need me to come and get this?

Bellatrix Lestrange:
You dare speak his name? You filthy half-blood!

Lucius Malfoy:
It's alright, he's just a curious lad, aren't you? Prophecies can only be retrieved by those about whom they are made. Which is lucky for you, really. [whispers] Haven't you always wondered what was the reason for the connection between you and the Dark Lord? Why he was unable to kill you, when you were just an infant? Don't you want to know the secret of your scar? All the answers are there, Potter, in your hand. All you have to do, is give it to me, and I can show you everything.

[The Death Eaters surround Harry's group]

Harry:
I waited 14 years.

Lucius Malfoy:
[in mock sympathy] I know.

Harry:
Guess I can wait a little longer. Now!

Harry, Ron, Neville & Ginny:
Stupefy!

Hermione & Luna:
Stupefy!

Lucius Malfoy:
Did you actually believe, or were you truly naive enough to think that children stood a chance, against us? I'll make this simple for you, Potter. Give me the prophecy now, or watch your friends die.

Neville:
Don't give it to him, Harry!

Bellatrix Lestrange:
Sst!

[Harry hesitates but hands over the prophecy. Malfoy holds it up and a white light distracts them.]

Sirius:
Get away from my godson. [punches Malfoy]

Sirius:
Now listen to me. I want you to take the others and get out of here.

Harry:
What? No. I'm staying with you--

Sirius:
You've done beautifully. Now let me take it from here.

Harry:
Expelliarmus!

Sirius:
Nice one James!

Bellatrix Lestrange:
Avada Kedavra!

Bellatrix Lestrange:
[Laughing] I killed Sirius Black! You coming to get me?!

Harry:
Crucio!

[Bellatrix screams and falls to the ground]

Voldemort:
[Inside Harry's head] You've got to mean it, Harry. She killed him. She deserves it. You know the spell, Harry. [Voldemort appears behind Harry] Do it! [Harry turns around and is easily disarmed by Voldemort] So weak!

Dumbledore:
It was foolish of you to come here tonight, Tom. The Aurors are on their way.

Voldemort:
By which time I shall be gone. And you... shall be dead.

Harry:
[While being possessed by Voldemort] You... you've lost, old man.

Dumbledore:
Harry.

Voldemort:
So weak, so vulnerable! Look at me!

Dumbledore:
Harry, it isn't how you are alike. It's how you are not! [Pause] Harry.

[As Harry sees his friends enter the Atrium, he remembers the happy times he spent with them.]

Harry:
...You're the weak one. And you'll never know love, or friendship. And I feel sorry for you.

[Voldemort is forced out of Harry's body.]

Voldemort:
You're a fool, Harry Potter. And you will lose everything.

[The Aurors arrive at the scene. Voldemort quickly teleports away. But Fudge has a look of shock on his face.]

Fudge:
He's back.

Dumbledore:
I know how you feel Harry.

Harry:
No you don't. It's my fault.

Dumbledore:
No, the fault is mine! I knew it was only a matter of time before Voldemort made the connection between you. I thought by distancing myself from you, as I have done all year, he'd be less tempted and therefore you might be more protected.

Harry:
The prophecy said: neither one can live for the other one survives. It means one of us is gonna have to kill the other... in the end?

Dumbledore:
Yes.

Harry:
Why didn't you tell me?

Dumbledore:
For the same reason you tried to save Sirius. For the same reason your friends saved you. After all these years, after all you suffered, I didn't want to cause you any more pain. I cared too much about you.

Harry:
How come you're not at the feast?

Luna:
Lost all my possessions. Apparently people have been hiding them.

Harry:
That's awful.

Luna:
Oh, it's all good fun. But as it's the last night, I really do need them back. I'm sorry about your godfather, Harry. [holds Harry's hand for a few seconds, then releases it]

Harry:
Are you sure you don't want any help looking?

Luna:
That's alright. Anyway, my mum always said, things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end... [They see shoes hanging at the ceiling] if not always in the way we expect. Think I'll just go have some pudding.

[Last lines]

Harry:
I've been thinking about something Dumbledore said to me.

Hermione:
What's that?

Harry:
That even though we got a fight ahead of us, we've got one thing that Voldemort doesn't have.

Ron:
Yeah?

Harry:
Something worth fighting for.

The Rebellion Begins

Only One Can Survive

The Only Way Is Rebellion

No One Can Protect You

Evil Must Be Confronted

You Will Lose Everything

Make A Final Stand

Dissent Will Not Be Tolerated

I Must Not Tell Lies

Harry:
[sees a strange reptilian-like thestrals] What is it?

Ron:
What's what?

Harry:
That. Pulling the carriage.

Hermione:
Nothing's pulling the carriage, Harry. It's pulling itself like always.

[Harry walks around the carriage, where Luna is already seated]

Luna:
You're not going mad. [lowers her magazine, The Quibbler, which she has been reading upside down] I see them too. You're just as sane as I am.

[about the thestrals]

Harry:
So why can't the others see them?

Luna:
They can only be seen by people who've seen death.

Harry:
So... you've known someone who's died?

Luna:
My mum. She was quite an extraordinary witch, but she did like to experiment, and one day one of her spells went badly wrong. I was nine.

Harry:
I'm sorry.

Luna:
Yes, it was rather horrible. I do feel very sad about it sometimes. But I've got Dad. We both believe you, by the way. That He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back and you fought him and the Ministry and the Prophet are conspiring against you and Dumbledore.

Harry:
Thanks. It seems you're about the only ones that do.

Luna:
I don't think that's true. But I suppose that's how he wants you to feel.

Harry:
What do you mean?

Luna:
Well, if I were You-Know-Who, I'd want you to feel cut off from everyone else. Because if it's just you alone, you're not as much of a threat.

Hermione:
What's wrong with your hand?

Harry:
Nothing. [shows her his right hand]

Hermione:
Your other hand. [grabs his left arm, and sees his scars from Umbridge's detention] [horrified] You've got to tell Dumbledore!

Harry:
No. Dumbledore's got enough on his mind right now. Anyway, I don't want to give Umbridge the satisfaction.

Ron:
Bloody hell, Harry, the woman's torturing you! If the parents knew about this-!

Harry:
Yeah, well, I haven't got any of those, have I, Ron?

Hermione:
Harry, you've got to report this. It's perfectly simple - you're being-

Harry:
No, it's not. Hermione, whatever this, it's not simple. You don't understand.

Hermione:
[frustrated] Then help us to.

Hermione:
Um... Hi! You all know why we're here. We need a teacher. A proper teacher. One who's had real experience defending themselves against the Dark Arts.

Zacharias:
Why?

Ron:
Why. Because You-Know-Who's back, you tosspot.

Zacharias:
[nods toward Harry] So he says.

Hermione:
So Dumbledore says.

Zacharias:
So Dumbledore says because he says! The point is, where's the proof?

Boy:
If Potter could tell us more about how Diggory got killed...

Harry:
I'm not going to talk about Cedric, so if that's why you're here you might as well clear out now. [aside to Hermione] C'mon, Hermione, let's go. They're just here because they think I'm some sort of freak.

Hermione:
Harry, wait!

Luna:
Is it true you can produce a Patronus charm?

Hermione:
Yes. I've seen it.

Dean:
Blimey, Harry! I didn't know you could do that!

Neville:
And he killed a basilisk, with the sword in Dumbledore's office.

Ginny:
It's true.

Ron:
Third year he fought off about a hundred dementors at once.

Hermione:
And last year he really did fight off You-Know-Who in the flesh.

Harry:
Wait... look, it all sounds great when you say it like that. But the truth is most of that was just luck. I didn't know what I was doing half the time, I nearly always had help...

Hermione:
He's just being modest.

Harry:
No, Hermione, I'm not! Facing this stuff in real life is not like school. In school, if you make a mistake you can just try again tomorrow. But out there, when you're a second away from being murdered or watching a friend die right before your eyes... you don't know what that's like.

Hermione:
You're right, Harry, we don't. That's why we need your help. Because if we're having any chance against beating... Voldemort.

Nigel:
He's really back?

[Harry nods]

[practicing stunning spells]

Ron:
Don't worry, I'll go easy on you.

Hermione:
[sarcastically] Thanks, Ronald.

[They face off on opposite ends of the room.]

Fred:
One Sickle.

George:
You're on.

[Hermione floors Ron. George passes Fred a Sickle.]

Fred:
Thank you.

George:
Shut up.

[Ron gets up; walks to Fred and George]:
I let her do that. It’s good manners, isn’t it?

Severus Snape:
Control your emotions! Discipline your mind!

Harry Potter:
[after Dumbledore announced Umbridge the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, whispering to Hermione] She was at my hearing. She works for Fudge.

Kingsley Shacklebolt:
You may not like him, Minister, but you can't deny: Dumbledore's got style.

Harry Potter:
Not to mention the pincers. (Makes pincer-like movements with hands)

Harry Potter:
(after Dumbledore asks him if he has feelings for Hermione) Oh no, no, no, I mean she's brilliant, but we're friends.

Harry Potter:
I've got a really good feeling about Hagrid's. I feel it's... it's the place to be tonight.

Harry Potter:
(After witnessing Dumbledore's murder) Snape! He trusted you!

Harry Potter:
(When Slughorn asks him how he got out of the castle) Oh, through the front door, sir.

Albus Dumbledore:
Years ago, I knew a boy who made all the wrong choices. Please let me help you.

Albus Dumbledore:
Being me has its privileges.

Albus Dumbledore:
Now as you know, each and every one of you was searched upon your arrival here tonight and you have the right to know why. Once there was a young man, who like you, sat in this very hall, walked this castle's corridors, slept under its roofs. He seemed to all the world a student like any other. His name: Tom Riddle. [Murmuring erupts among the students] Today, of course, he's known all over the world by another name, which is why, as I stand looking out upon you all tonight, I'm reminded of a sobering fact: Every day, every hour, this very minute, perhaps, dark forces attempt to penetrate this castle's walls. [pause] But in the end, their greatest weapon... is you. There's something to think about. Now off to bed, pip pip.

Albus Dumbledore:
(repeated line) Harry do as I say.

Ron Weasley:
[After Hermione catches him trying to touch her face] Got a bit of toothpaste...

Ron Weasley:
Those girls - they're gonna kill me, Harry!

Ron Weasley:
I'm a free agent.

Ron Weasley:
Was it fun, then? The Slug Club?

Ron Weasley:
So, did you and Ginny do it?

Ron Weasley:
[under influence of a love potion, hugging Slughorn] Hello, darling. Fancy a drink?

Ron Weasley:
(repeated line) Oh, Bloody hell...

Hermione Granger:
[After seeing Ron cuddling with Lavender] Excuse me, I have to go and vomit.

Hermione Granger:
You have to realize who you are, Harry.

Hermione Granger:
How does it feel Harry? When you see Dean with Ginny?

Hermione Granger:
I happen to be his...friend!

Severus Snape:
It's over.

Severus Snape:
[After Bellatrix calls him a coward and says that she doesn't think he will make the Unbreakable Vow] Take out your wand.

Draco Malfoy:
[Alone in his compartment on the train with Harry hiding under the Cloak; quietly] Didn't Mummy ever tell you it was rude to eavesdrop, Potter? Petrificus Totalus! [Harry falls, still hidden] Oh, right. She was dead before you could wipe the drool off your chin. [Kicks Harry in the face, breaking his nose] That's for my father. [Covers Harry with the cloak] Enjoy your trip back to London.

Horace Slughorn:
[in regard to returning to Hogwarts] All right, I'll do it! But I want Professor Merrythought's office, not that water closet I had before. And I expect a raise, these are mad times we live in. MAD!

Horace Slughorn:
[repeated line] Merlin's Beard!

Horace Slughorn:
[Telling Harry the story of his deceased fish] It was a student who gave me Francis. One spring afternoon I discovered a bowl on my desk with just a few inches of clear water in it. And floating on the surface was a flower petal. As I watched, it sank. Just before it reached the bottom, it was transformed into a wee fish. It was beautiful magic, wonderous to behold. The flower petal had come from a lily. Your mother. The day I came downstairs, the day the bowl was empty, was the day your mother... I know why you're here, but I can't help you. It would ruined me.

Professor McGonagall:
Potter, take Weasley with you. He looks far too happy over there.

Arthur Weasley:
Times like these, dark times, they do funny things to people. They can tear them apart.

Ginny Weasley:
[after kissing Harry in the Room of Requirement] That can stay up here too, if you like.

Luna Lovegood:
I've never been to this part of the castle. Well, not when I'm awake. I sleep-walk, you see. That's why I wear shoes to bed.

Katie Bell:
I know what you're going to ask me Harry, but... I don't remember who cursed me.

Ginny Weasley:
[to Harry in the Room of Requirement] Close your eyes...

Muggle girl:
Harry Potter. Who's Harry Potter?

Harry Potter :
No one, bit of a tosser really.

Muggle Girl:
Funny that paper of yours, a couple minutes ago I could have sworn I saw a picture move.

Harry Potter:
Hey, I was wondering--

Muggle Girl:
11. That's when I get off. You can tell me all about that tosser Harry Potter.

Albus Dumbledore:
[To Harry] You are, of course, wondering why it is I have brought you here tonight.

Harry Potter:
Actually, sir, after all these years, I just sorta go with it.

Horace Slughorn:
Merlins Beard, no need to disfigure me Albus.

[After exposing Slughorn's disguise]

Albus Dumbledore:
I must say, you make a very convincing armchair, Horace.

Horace Slughorn:
[pats his stomach] I come by the stuffing naturally. What gave me away?

Dumbledore:
So what's with all the theatrics Horace? You weren't by any chance waiting for someone else, were you?

Horace Slughorn:
Someone else? I'm sure I don't know what you mean... Oh alright. The Death Eaters have been trying to recruit me for over a year, you know what that's like? You can only say no to these people so many times, so I never stay anywhere more than a week. The Muggles who own this place are in the Canary Islands.

Ginny:
[sees Hedwig and Harry's trunk in the kitchen] Hedwig? [calls upstairs] Mum?

Molly Weasley:
Ginny? What is it?

Ginny:
I was only wondering when Harry got here.

Molly:
What? Harry? Harry who?

Ginny:
Harry Potter of course.

Molly:
I think I'd know if Harry Potter was in my house, wouldn't I?

Ginny:
His trunk is in the kitchen. And his owl.

Molly:
No dear, I seriously doubt that.

[Hedwig chirps]

Ron:
Harry? Did someone say Harry?

Ginny:
Me, nosy. Is he up there with you?

Ron:
Of course not. I'd think I'd know if my best friend was in my room, wouldn't I?

Hermione:
Is that an owl I heard?

Ginny:
You haven't seen him, have you? Apparently he's been wandering about the house.

Hermione:
[eagerly] Really?

Harry:
[From the door] Really.

[Ron holds up a small box at Fred and George's shop]

Ron:
How much is this?

Fred and George:
Five Galleons.

Ron:
How much for me?

Fred and George:
Five Galleons.

Ron:
I'm your brother!

Fred and George:
Ten Galleons.

Harry Potter:
Sorry I made you miss the carriages by the way, Luna.

Luna Lovegood:
That's alright. It was like being with a friend.

Harry Potter:
Oh, I am your friend, Luna.

Luna Lovegood:
That's nice.

Filius Flitwick:
Oh, about time. I've been looking all over for you two! Names?

Harry Potter:
Professor Flitwick, you've known me for five years.

Filius Flitwick:
No exceptions, Potter!

Luna Lovegood:
[regarding Harry's broken nose] Would you like me to fix that for you? I think it makes you look a bit more Devil-may-care, but it's up to you...

Harry Potter:
Um, well, have you fixed noses before?

Luna Lovegood:
No, but I've done several toes. How different are they really?

Ron:
[to Hermione and Ginny] Don't worry. He'll be here in a minute. [starts eating]

Hermione:
[smacks him on the arm with a book] Will you stop eating? Your best friend is missing!

Ron:
Oi. Turn around, you lunatic!

[Hermione and Ginny looks towards the Great Hall door and see Harry covered in blood.]

Ginny:
He's covered in blood again. Why is it he's always covered in blood?

Ron:
Looks like it's his own this time.

Dumbledore:
I'm like you, Tom. I'm different.

Tom Riddle:
Prove it.

[Dumbledore continues to look at Tom, then the wardrobe behind them bursts into flame.]

Dumbledore:
I think there's something in your wardrobe that wants out, Tom.

[Harry and Dumbledore have just seen Dumbledore's memory of his first meeting with Tom Riddle.]

Harry Potter:
Did you know, sir? Then?

Albus Dumbledore:
Did I know that I just met the most dangerous dark wizard of all time? No.

Horace Slughorn:
What about you, Miss Granger? What do your parents do in the Muggle world?

Hermione Granger:
My parents are dentists. [Everyone except Harry looks at her in confusion] They tend to people's teeth.

Horace Slughorn:
Fascinating. And is that considered a dangerous profession?

Hermione:
No... Although, one boy, Robbie Fenwick did bite my father once. He needed ten stitches.

[Once again, everyone except Harry looks at her in confusion]

[Harry, Ron and Hermione are discussing the Half Blood Prince]

Hermione:
I went to-

Ron and Harry:
The library!

Harry Potter:
What brings you here, sir?

Horace Slughorn:
[good-naturedly/drunkenly] Oh, the Three Broomsticks and I go way back! Farther back than I care to admit! Ho ho ho... Why I can remember when it was just ONE Broomstick! [Slughorn chuckles and spills his drink all over the table, splashing Hermione; she jumps away] Whoops! All hands on deck, there, Granger!

Professor Minerva McGonagall:
[to Harry, Ron, and Hermione] Why is it, whenever something happens, it is always you three?

Ron Weasley:
Believe me, Professor, I've been asking myself the same question for six years.

[About the cursed necklace]

Harry Potter:
It was Malfoy.

Minerva McGonagall:
That is a very serious accusation, Potter!

Severus Snape:
Indeed. Your evidence?

Harry Potter:
I just know.

Severus Snape:
You just know? [pause] Once again you astonish with your gifts Potter, gifts mere mortals can only dream of possessing. How grand it must be... to be the Chosen One.

Ron Weasley:
[about Ginny and Dean] What is it he sees in her?

Harry Potter:
She's smart... funny... attractive...

Ron:
Attractive?

Harry:
Well you know... she has nice... skin.

Ron:
Skin. So you think Dean's dating my sister because of her skin?

Harry:
Well, no, I'm just saying it could be a contributing factor.

Ron:
Hermione's got nice skin. You know, as skin goes, I mean.

Harry:
I-I've never really thought about it. But I suppose, yeah. Very nice. [long pause] ...I think I'll be going to sleep now.

[After the Quidditch match, before which Harry pretended to put Felix Felicis in Ron's drink]

Hermione Granger:
[To Harry] You really shouldn't have done it.

Harry Potter:
I know. I suppose I could've just used a Confundus Charm.

Hermione Granger:
That was different. That was tryouts. This was an actual game. [Harry takes the vial of Felix Felicis out of his shirt pocket and shows it to Hermione, who looks at it in confusion] You didn't put it in. Ron only thought you did.

[Hermione has run off from a Quidditch celebration party after seeing Ron kiss Lavender Brown. Harry finds her in a classroom with some birds flying around her.]

Hermione:
(Tearfully) Charms spell. I'm just practicing.

Harry:
Well, they're really good. (sits down)

Hermione:
How does it feel, Harry? When you see Dean with Ginny? I know. I see the way you look at her. You're my best friend.

[Ron and Lavender come running in, laughing. Harry gives them a dirty look.]

Lavender:
Oops! I think this room's taken! (runs off)

Ron:
What's with the birds?

[Hermione stands up angrily.]

Hermione:
Oppugno.

[Ron runs off and the birds chase him, crashing into the door. Ron leaves. Hermione sits down and starts to cry into Harry's shoulder.]

Harry:
It feels like this.

Hermionie Granger:
[about Romilda Vane] She's only interested in you because she thinks you're the Chosen One.

Harry Potter:
But I am the Chosen One. [Hermione hits on the head with a rolled up newspaper.] Sorry, um, kidding.

[Hermione is being offered a snack at Slughorn's Christmas party after evading Cormac McLaggen.]

Waiter:
Dragon Tartare?

Hermione:
No thanks.

Waiter:
Probably just as well, they give one terrible breath.

Hermione:
On second thoughts... [takes the platter and helps herself to said snack] Maybe they'll keep McLaggen at bay. God, here he comes!

[McLaggen eats one of the snacks off of a tray Harry is holding while talking to him.]

McLaggen:
What's this I'm eating, by the way?

Harry:
[tentative] Dragon Balls.

[Snape joins them behind the curtain. McLaggen throws up on Snape's shoes.]

Snape:
[pause] You've just bought yourself a month's detention, McLaggen - [Harry tries to leave] not... so quick, Potter!

[Ginny has stolen a place beside Harry on the couch in a secluded corner of the house on Christmas Eve. She has an eager expression. Mr. Weasley gets up and walks off]

Ginny:
[taking a mince pie from the plate on her lap] Open up, you. [Smiling broadly as he looks surprised] Don't you trust me? [she feeds him the mince pie]

Harry:
It's good...

[Ron approaches and sits down between them with a platter of even larger mince pies. Ginny looks somewhat crestfallen, as does Harry.]

Ron:
[as he is sitting down] Yeah, I'll just... Get... Yeah. [Offering the platter] Pie?

Harry:
[curtly] Not for me, no.

[Harry, still fully dressed, is sitting on the steps looking uneasily out of the window. Ginny, who has evidently just washed, runs into him on her way up to bed.]

Ginny:
(looking delighted) Has Ron gone to bed?

Harry:
Um... (looks upstairs) not yet, no.

Ginny:
(indicating his feet) Shoelace.

[Harry bends down to re-tie his shoelaces, but Ginny gets there first. When she has finished, she straightens up and moves closer to him.]

Ginny:
Merry Christmas, Harry.

Harry:
Merry Christmas.

[They lean in to kiss, but Bellatrix's fireball interrupts them.]

[Harry watches a faked memory of Tom Riddle at a Slug Club dinner party.]

Horace Slughorn:
[To Tom] I'd like to know where you get your information. More knowledgeable than half the staff, you are. [Someone in Tom's gang laughs]

Tom Riddle:
Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?

Horace Slughorn:
[Eating pineapple] Now, Tom, I couldn't tell you if I knew, could I? By the way, thank you for the pineapple. You're quite right, it is my favorite. But how did you know?

Tom Riddle:
[Thinks of a response] Intuition.

Horace Slughorn:
[Smiles, then looks at a clock that has gone off] Good gracious, is it that time, already? Off you go, boys, or Professor Dippet will have us all in detention. [Everyone but Tom leaves. Tom taps the hourglass, and Slughorn notices Tom is still there] Look sharp, Tom. Don't want to be caught out of bed after hours. Is something on your mind, Tom?

Tom Riddle:
Yes, sir. You see, I couldn't think of anyone else to go to. The other professors, well, they're not like you. They might misunderstand.

Horace Slughorn:
Go on.

Tom Riddle:
[Approaching Slughorn] I was in the library the other day, in the Restricted Section, and I read something rather odd about a bit of rare magic, and I thought, perhaps, you could illuminate me. It's called, as I understand it... [He makes an unintelligable sound and Slughorn stares in bewilderment.]

Horace Slughorn:
I beg your pardon? I don't know anything about such things and if I did, I wouldn't tell you! Now get out of here at once AND DON'T EVER LET ME CATCH YOU MENTIONING IT AGAIN! [The memory becomes cloudy and ends]

Ron:
[under the effect of a love potion, fawning over Romilda Vane] I'm in love with her!

Harry:
All right, fine, you're in love with her. Have you ever actually met her?

Ron:
[Realizing] No. [Excitedly] Could you introduce me?

Lavender Brown:
(noticing Hermione at Ron's side in the Hospital Wing) What's she doing here!?

Hermione:
I might ask you the same question!

Lavender:
I happen to be his girlfriend!

Hermione:
I happen to be his... friend.

Lavender:
Don't make me laugh. You haven't spoken in weeks! I suppose you want to make up now that he's suddenly all interesting!

Hermione:
He's been poisoned, you daft dimbo! And for the record, I've always found him interesting.

[Ron stirs]

Lavender Brown:
Ah! See? He senses my presence. [leans down] Don't worry, Won-Won! I'm here. I'm here.

Ron Weasley:
[croaks] Uh... Hermione... Her... my... nee. Hermione...

[Hermione tenderly takes Ron's hand. Lavender runs out in tears. Awkward silence.]

Albus Dumbledore:
[jovially] Oh, to be young and to feel love's keen sting. Well, come away everyone... Mr. Weasley is well tended.

[They all leave]

Ginny:
(whispering to Harry) About time, too. Don't you think?

Harry:
(To Madam Pomfrey as she puts something on Ron's bedside table) Thank you.

Hermione:
(noticing Harry's expression) Oh, shut up.

(Harry leaves as Hermione continues to clutch Ron's hand and smile tenderly at him.)

[Slughorn is snipping tentacular leaves through a window in the greenhouse. Harry, who is walking by, notices Slughorn and walks up behind him, startling him.]

Horace Slughorn:
[Gasps in surprise] Merlin's beard, Harry!

Harry Potter:
Oh, sorry, sir, I should've announced myself. Cleared my throat. Coughed. You probably feared I was Professor Sprout!

Horace Slughorn:
Yes, I did actually! ...What made you think that?

Harry Potter:
Oh, well, just the general behavior, sir - the sneaking around, jumping when you saw me... Are those tentacular leaves, sir? They're very valuable, aren't they?

Horace Slughorn:
Ten Galleons a leaf to the right buyer! ...Not that I'm familiar with any such back alley transactions, but one does hear rumors. My own interests are purely academic, of course.

Harry Potter:
Personally, these plants always kind of freak me out.

[Harry says he is in a hurry to get to Hagrid's and says he must go]

Horace Slughorn:
[Astounded] HARRY!

Harry Potter:
[Similarly] Sir?

[Slughorn pursues Harry, under the influence of Felix Felicis, across the grounds.]

Horace Slughorn:
Harry, I must insist you accompany me back to the castle immediately!

Harry Potter:
That would be counter-productive, sir!

Horace Slughorn:
What makes you say that?

Harry Potter:
No idea.

Horace Slughorn:
[Seeing Aragog's corpse] Merlin's beard! Is that an actual Acromantula?

Harry Potter:
A dead one, I think, sir.

Horace Slughorn:
[To Hagrid] Dear man, however did you manage to kill it?!

[Trying to persuade Slughorn, who is drunk, to divulge his true memory]

Harry:
I'm going to tell you something - something others have only guessed at. It's true. I am the Chosen One, only I can destroy him, but in order to do so, I need to know what Tom Riddle asked you all those years ago in your office, and I need to know what you told him. Be brave, sir. Be brave like my mother. Otherwise you disgrace her. Otherwise she died for nothing. Otherwise the bowl will remain empty, forever.

Slughorn:
Please... don't think badly of me when you see it. You've no idea how he was like, even then. [Withdraws memory]

[Harry watches Slughorn's real memory, which starts with Tom tapping the hourglass]

Tom Riddle:
[approaching Slughorn] I was in the library the other day, in the Restricted Section, and I read something rather odd about a bit of rare magic. It's called, as I understand it... Horcruxes.

Horace Slughorn:
I beg your pardon?

Tom Riddle:
Horcruxes. I came across the term while reading and I didn't fully understand it.

Horace Slughorn:
I'm not sure what you were reading, Tom, but this is very dark stuff. Very dark indeed.

Tom Riddle:
Which is why I came to you.

Horace Slughorn:
[Stares at Tom for a second] A Horcrux is an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul.

Tom Riddle:
But I don't understand how that works, Sir.

Horace Slughorn:
One splits ones soul and hides part of it in an object. By doing so, you are protected, should you be attacked and your body destroyed.

Tom Riddle:
Protected?

Horace Slughorn:
That part of your soul that is hidden lives on. In other words, you cannot die.

Tom Riddle:
[Looks into the fireplace] And how does one split his soul, sir?

Horace Slughorn:
I think you already know the answer to that, Tom.

Tom Riddle:
Murder.

Horace Slughorn:
Yes. Killing rips the soul apart. It's a violation against nature.

Tom Riddle:
[Adjusting ring on his finger, the same one in present day Dumbledore's office] Can you only split the soul once? For instance, isn't seven...

Horace Slughorn:
Seven? Merlin's beard, Tom! Isn't it bad enough to consider killing one person? To rip the soul into seven pieces... This is all hypothetical, isn't it, Tom? All academic?

Tom Riddle:
[Smiling] Of course, sir. It'll be our little secret.

[Memory goes cloudy and ends]

Albus Dumbledore:
Good evening, Draco. What brings you here on this fine, spring evening?

Draco Malfoy:
Who else is here? I heard you talking.

Albus Dumbledore:
I often talk aloud to myself. I find it extraordinarily useful. Have you been whispering to you yourself, Draco? Draco, you are no assassin.

Draco Malfoy:
How do you know what I am?! I've done things that would shock you!

Albus Dumbledore:
Like cursing Katie Bell and hoping that, in return, she would bear a cursed necklace to me? Like replacing a bottle of mead with one laced with poison? Forgive me, Draco, but I cannot help feeling these actions are so weak that your heart couldn't really be in them.

Draco Malfoy:
He trusts me! I was chosen! [reveals the Dark Mark on his left arm]

Albus Dumbledore:
I shall make it easy for you... [raises his wand]

Draco Malfoy:
Expelliarmus!

Albus Dumbledore:
[wand flies out of his hand] Very good, very good. [door opens in the distance] You're not alone? There are others? How?

Draco Malfoy:
The Vanishing Cabinet in the Room of Requirement. I've been mending it.

Albus Dumbledore:
Let me guess; It has a sister? A twin?

Draco Malfoy:
At Borgin & Burke's. They form a passage.

Albus Dumbledore:
Ingenius. Draco, years ago, I knew a boy who made all the wrong choices. Please let me help you.

Draco Malfoy:
[breaking into tears] I don't want your help! Don't you understand? I have to do this! I have to kill you! Or he's going to kill me...

Bellatrix Lestrange:
[walking into the astronomy tower followed by Death Eaters] Well, look what we have here. Well done, Draco!

Albus Dumbledore:
Good evening, Bellatrix. I think introductions are called for.

Bellatrix Lestrange:
Love to, Albus, but I'm afraid we're on a bit of a tight schedule. [to Draco] Do it!

Fenrir Greyback:
He doesn't have the stomach... just like his father. Let me finish him in my own way.

Bellatrix Lestrange:
No! The Dark Lord was clear; The boy's to do it. This is your moment. Do it! Go on, Draco! NOW!

Severus Snape:
No. [steps in]

Albus Dumbledore:
Severus... please.

[short pause]

Severus Snape:
Avada Kedavra!

[The spell hits Dumbledore. He is knocked over the rail behind him and falls from the tower]

Harry Potter:
Incarcerous! [Snape blocks the spell] Fight back! You coward, fight back!

[Bellatrix knocks Harry backwards with a spell]

Severus Snape:
No! He belongs to the Dark Lord!

[Bellatrix reluctantly walks away. Snape glances at Harry briefly before beginning to leave.]

Harry Potter:
Sectumsempra!

[Snape knocks Harry backwards, then approaches him slowly]

Severus Snape:
You dare use my own spells against me, Potter? [Harry stares in horror] Yes. I'm the Half-Blood Prince. [Kicks Harry's wand away and leaves]

[Harry emerges from a corner hiding from Draco who turns sharply]

Harry:
Sectumsempra

[The spell hits Draco who gets knocked aside. Harry then looks at Draco who lies on the floor bleeding. Snape then appears before Draco and presses his wand into Draco's wounds]

Snape:
Vulnera Sanentur [as he speaks the wounds inflicted by Harry heal]

Dark Secrets Revealed

Once again I must ask too much of you, Harry

To know the future, you must return to the past

[Harry and Dumbledore have just Apparated to Budleigh Babberton to meet Slughorn]

Harry:
I just Apparated, didn't I?

Dumbledore:
Indeed. And quite successfully I might add. Most people vomit their first time.

Harry:
Can't imagine why...

Dumbledore:
You are, of course, wondering why it is I have brought you here tonight.

Harry:
Actually, sir, after all these years, I just sorta go with it.

[Dumbledore has just exposed Slughorn, disguised as an armchair]

Slughorn:
Merlin's Beard! No need to disfigure me, Albus.

Dumbledore:
I must say, you make a very convincing armchair, Horace.

Slughorn:
It's all in the upholstery. [pats his stomach] I come by the stuffing naturally. What gave me away?

Dumbledore:
[points to stains in room] Dragon's blood.

Luna:
[regarding Harry's broken nose] Would you like me to fix that for you? I think you look a little devil-may-care this way, but it's up to you...

Harry:
Um... have you fixed a nose before?

Luna:
No, but I've done several toes. How different are they, really?

Harry:
...Okay, yeah, sure, give it a go.

Luna:
Episkey!

[a loud crack is heard]

Harry:
Augh...!

[rubs his nose gingerly; looks at Luna]

Harry:
Well? How do I look?

Luna:
Exceptionally ordinary.

Harry:
...Brilliant.

[Harry and Ron are laying in bed]

Slughorn:
Some of your classmates... well, let's just say they're unlikely to make the shelf.

Harry:
Shelf, sir?

[Slughorn points to a wall of portraits of his favorite students.]

Slughorn:
Anyone who aspires to be anyone ends up here. But then again, you already are someone, aren't you, Harry?

Harry:
Did Voldemort ever make the shelf, sir? [Slughorn freezes] You knew him, didn't you, sir? Tom Riddle? You were his teacher.

Slughorn:
Mr. Riddle had a number of teachers whilst he was here at Hogwarts.

Harry:
What was he like? [no response] I'm sorry, sir. Forgive me. He killed my parents.

Slughorn:
I... of course, it's only natural you should want to know more. But I'm afraid I must disappoint you, Harry. When I first met young Mr. Riddle, he was a quiet, albeit brilliant boy committed to becoming a first-rate wizard. Not unlike others I've known. Not unlike yourself, in fact. If the monster existed, it was buried deep within.

[Hermione is being offered an hors d’oeuvre at Slughorn's Christmas party after evading McLaggen]

Waiter:
Dragon Tartare?

Hermione:
No, I’m fine, thank you.

Waiter:
Probably just as well, they give one horrible breath.

Hermione:
On second thoughts... [Grabs tray and gobbles one] Maybe it'll keep Cormac at bay... oh God, here he comes!

[Hermione slips out before she is seen by McLaggen]

Harry:
I think she just went to powder her nose.

McLaggen:
Slippery little minx your friend is. Likes to work her mouth, too, doesn’t she?

[McLaggen eats one of the hors d’oeuvres off of a tray Harry is holding while talking to him.]

McLaggen:
What is this I'm eating, by the way?

Harry:
[tentative] Dragon Balls.

[Snape joins them behind the curtain. McLaggen throws up on Snape's shoes.]

Snape:
[pause] You've just bought yourself a month's detention, McLaggen - [Harry tries to leave] not... so quick, Potter!

Harry:
Sir, I really think I should rejoin the party. My date...

Snape:
Can surely survive another minute or two. Besides, I only wish to convey a message.

Harry:
Message?

Snape:
From Professor Dumbledore. He asked me to give you his best and he hopes you enjoy your holiday. You see, he’s traveling, and he won’t return until term resumes.

Harry:
Traveling where?

[Snape is silent and then walks off.]

Ginny:
Close your eyes. That way you can’t be tempted. [she hides the Half-Blood Prince's book, then kisses Harry] That can stay hidden up here too, if you like.

[a short time later, Harry is walking down the hallway, in a daze. Ron appears beside him]

Ron:
So, did you and Ginny do it, then?

Harry:
[alarmed] What?

Ron:
You know, hide the book?

Harry:
Oh... yeah.

“Mr. Moony presents his compliments to Professor Snape, and begs him to keep his abnormally large nose out of other people's business. Mr. Prongs agrees with Mr. Moony, and would like to add that Professor Snape is an ugly git. Mr. Padfoot would like to register his astonishment that an idiot like that ever became a professor. Mr. Wormtail bids Professor Snape good day, and advises him to wash his hair, the slimeball.”

You've just bought yourself a month's detention,Mclaggen! NOT SO QUICK POTTER......YEET!


Katie Bell:
I know you're going to ask Harry, but I don't know who cursed me. I’ve been trying to remember, honestly. But I just can’t.

Severus Snape:
You dare use my own spells against me, Potter? Yes. I'M the Half-Blood Prince.

Muggle girl:
Harry Potter. Who's Harry Potter?

Harry Potter :
No one, bit of a tosser really.

Muggle Girl:
Funny that paper of yours, a couple minutes ago I could have sworn I saw a picture move.

Harry Potter:
Hey, I was wondering--

Muggle Girl:
11. That's when I get off. You can tell me all about that tosser Harry Potter.

Albus Dumbledore:
[To Harry] You are, of course, wondering why it is I have brought you here tonight.

Harry Potter:
Actually, sir, after all these years, I just sorta go with it.

[Dumbledore has just exposed Slughorn, disguised as an armchair]

Horace Slughorn:
Merlin's Beard! No need to disfigure me, Albus.

Albus Dumbledore:
I must say, you make a very convincing armchair, Horace.

Horace Slughorn:
It's all in the upholstery. [pats his stomach] I come by the stuffing naturally. What gave me away?

Albus Dumbledore:
[points to stains in room] Dragon's blood.

Dumbledore:
So what's with all the theatrics, Horace? You weren't by any chance waiting for someone else, were you?

Horace Slughorn:
Someone else? I'm sure I don't know what you mean... Oh alright. The Death Eaters have been trying to recruit me for over a year, you know what that's like? You can only say no to these people so many times, so I never stay anywhere more than a week. The Muggles who own this place are in the Canary Islands.

Ginny:
[sees Hedwig and Harry's trunk in the kitchen] Hedwig? [calls upstairs] Mum?

Molly Weasley:
Ginny? What is it?

Ginny:
I was only wondering when Harry got here.

Molly:
What? Harry? Harry who?

Ginny:
Harry Potter of course.

Molly:
I think I'd know if Harry Potter was in my house, wouldn't I?

Ginny:
His trunk is in the kitchen. And his owl.

Molly:
No dear, I seriously doubt that.

[Hedwig chirps]

Ron:
Harry? Did someone say Harry?

Ginny:
Me, nosy. Is he up there with you?

Ron:
Of course not. I'd think I'd know if my best friend was in my room, wouldn't I?

Hermione:
Is that an owl I heard?

Ginny:
You haven't seen him, have you? Apparently he's been wandering about the house.

Hermione:
[eagerly] Really?

Harry:
[From the door] Really.

[Ron holds up a small box at Fred and George's shop]

Ron:
How much is this?

Fred and George:
Five Galleons.

Ron:
How much for me?

Fred and George:
Five Galleons.

Ron:
I'm your brother!

Fred and George:
Ten Galleons.

Harry Potter:
Sorry I made you miss the carriages by the way, Luna.

Luna Lovegood:
That's alright. It was like being with a friend.

Harry Potter:
Oh, I am your friend, Luna.

Luna Lovegood:
That's nice.

Filius Flitwick:
Oh, about time. I've been looking all over for you two! Names?

Harry Potter:
Professor Flitwick, you've known me for five years.

Filius Flitwick:
No exceptions, Mr. Potter!

Luna Lovegood:
[regarding Harry's broken nose] Would you like me to fix that for you? I think it makes you look a bit more Devil-may-care, but it's up to you...

Harry Potter:
Um, well, have you fixed noses before?

Luna Lovegood:
No, but I've done several toes. How different are they, really?

Ron:
[to Hermione and Ginny] Don't worry. He'll be here in a minute. [starts eating]

Hermione:
[smacks him on the arm with a book] Will you stop eating? Your best friend is missing!

Ron:
Oi. Turn around, you lunatic!

[Hermione and Ginny looks towards the Great Hall door and see Harry covered in blood.]

Ginny:
He's covered in blood again. Why is it he's always covered in blood?

Ron:
Looks like it's his own this time.

Dumbledore:
I'm like you, Tom. I'm different.

Tom Riddle:
Prove it.

[Dumbledore continues to look at Tom, then the wardrobe behind them bursts into flame.]

Dumbledore:
I think there's something in your wardrobe that wants to come out, Tom.

[Harry and Dumbledore have just seen Dumbledore's memory of his first meeting with Tom Riddle.]

Harry Potter:
Did you know, sir? Then?

Albus Dumbledore:
Did I know that I just met the most dangerous dark wizard of all time? No.

Horace Slughorn:
What about you, Miss Granger? What do your parents do in the Muggle world?

Hermione Granger:
My parents are dentists. [Everyone except Harry looks at her in confusion] They tend to people's teeth.

Horace Slughorn:
Fascinating. And is that considered a dangerous profession?

Hermione:
No... Although, one boy, Robbie Fenwick did bite my father once. He needed ten stitches.

[Once again, everyone except Harry looks at her in confusion]

[Harry, Ron and Hermione are discussing the Half-Blood Prince]

Hermione:
I went to-

Ron and Harry:
The library!

Harry Potter:
What brings you here, sir?

Horace Slughorn:
[good-naturedly/drunkenly] Oh, the Three Broomsticks and I go way back! Farther back than I care to admit! Ho ho ho... Why I can remember when it was just ONE Broomstick! [Slughorn chuckles and spills his drink all over the table, splashing Hermione; she jumps away] Whoops! All hands on deck, there, Granger!

Professor Minerva McGonagall:
[to Harry, Ron, and Hermione] Why is it, whenever something happens, it is always you three?

Ron Weasley:
Believe me, Professor, I’ve been asking myself the same question for six years.

[About the cursed necklace]

Harry Potter:
It was Malfoy.

Minerva McGonagall:
That is a very serious accusation, Potter!

Severus Snape:
Indeed. Your evidence?

Harry Potter:
I just know.

Severus Snape:
You just know? [pause] Once again you astonish with your gifts Potter, gifts mere mortals can only dream of possessing. How grand it must be... to be the Chosen One.

Ron Weasley:
[about Ginny and Dean] What is it he sees in her?

Harry Potter:
She's smart... funny... attractive...

Ron:
Attractive?

Harry:
Well you know... she has nice... skin.

Ron:
Skin. So you think Dean's dating my sister because of her skin?

Harry:
Well, no, I'm just saying it could be a contributing factor.

Ron:
Hermione's got nice skin. You know, as skin goes, I mean.

Harry:
I-I've never really thought about it. But I suppose, yeah. Very nice. [long pause] ...I think I'll be going to sleep now.

Horace Slughorn:
Some of your classmates... well, let's just say they're unlikely to make the shelf.

Harry:
Shelf, sir?

[Slughorn points to a wall of portraits of his favorite students.]

Horace Slughorn:
Anyone who aspires to be anyone ends up here. But then again, you already are someone, aren't you, Harry?

Harry:
Did Voldemort ever make the shelf, sir? [Slughorn freezes] You knew him, didn't you, sir? Tom Riddle? You were his teacher.

When I first met young Mr. Riddle, he was a quiet, albeit brilliant boy committed to becoming a first-rate wizard. Not unlike others I've known. Not unlike yourself, in fact. If the monster existed, it was buried deep within.

[After the Quidditch match, before which Harry pretended to put Felix Felicis in Ron's drink]

Hermione Granger:
[To Harry] You really shouldn't have done it.

Harry Potter:
I know. I suppose I could've just used a Confundus Charm.

Hermione Granger:
That was different. That was tryouts. This was an actual game. [Harry takes the vial of Felix Felicis out of his shirt pocket and shows it to Hermione, who looks at it in confusion] You didn't put it in. Ron only thought you did.

[Hermione has run off from a Quidditch celebration party after seeing Ron kiss Lavender Brown. Harry finds her in a classroom with some birds flying around her.]

Hermione:
(Tearfully) Charms spell. I'm just practicing.

Harry:
Well, they're really good. (sits down)

Hermione:
How does it feel, Harry? When you see Dean with Ginny? I know. I see the way you look at her. You're my best friend.

[Ron and Lavender come running in, laughing. Harry gives them a dirty look.]

Lavender:
Oops! I think this room's taken! (runs off)

Ron:
What's with the birds?

[Hermione stands up angrily.]

Hermione:
Oppugno.

[Ron runs off and the birds chase him, crashing into the door. Ron leaves. Hermione sits down and starts to cry into Harry's shoulder.]

Harry:
It feels like this.

Hermionie Granger:
[about Romilda Vane] She's only interested in you because she thinks you're the Chosen One.

Harry Potter:
But I am the Chosen One. [Hermione hits on the head with a rolled up newspaper.] Sorry, um, kidding.

[Hermione is being offered a snack at Slughorn's Christmas party after evading Cormac McLaggen.]

Waiter:
Dragon Tartare?

Hermione:
No thanks.

Waiter:
Probably just as well, they give one terrible breath.

Hermione:
On second thoughts... [takes the platter and helps herself to said snack] Maybe they'll keep McLaggen at bay. God, here he comes!

[McLaggen eats one of the snacks off of a tray Harry is holding while talking to him.]

McLaggen:
What's this I'm eating, by the way?

Harry:
[tentative] Dragon Balls.

[Snape joins them behind the curtain. McLaggen throws up on Snape's shoes.]

Snape:
[pause] You've just bought yourself a month's detention, McLaggen - [Harry tries to leave] not... so quick, Potter!

[Ginny has stolen a place beside Harry on the couch in a secluded corner of the house on Christmas Eve. She has an eager expression. Mr. Weasley gets up and walks off]

Ginny:
[taking a mince pie from the plate on her lap] Open up, you. [Smiling broadly as he looks surprised] Don't you trust me? [she feeds him the mince pie]

Harry:
It's good...

[Ron approaches and sits down between them with a platter of even larger mince pies. Ginny looks somewhat crestfallen, as does Harry.]

Ron:
[as he is sitting down] Yeah, I'll just... Get... Yeah. [Offering the platter] Pie?

Harry:
[curtly] Not for me, no.

[Harry, still fully dressed, is sitting on the steps looking uneasily out of the window. Ginny, who has evidently just washed, runs into him on her way up to bed.]

Ginny:
(looking delighted) Has Ron gone to bed?

Harry:
Um... (looks upstairs) not yet, no.

Ginny:
(indicating his feet) Shoelace. [Harry bends down to re-tie his shoelaces, but Ginny gets there first. When she has finished, she straightens up and moves closer to him.] Merry Christmas, Harry.

Harry:
Merry Christmas.

[They lean in to kiss, but Bellatrix's fireball interrupts them.]

[Harry watches a faked memory of Tom Riddle at a Slug Club dinner party.]

Horace Slughorn:
[To Tom] I'd like to know where you get your information. More knowledgeable than half the staff, you are. [Someone in Tom's gang laughs]

Tom Riddle:
Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?

Horace Slughorn:
[Eating pineapple] Now, Tom, I couldn't tell you if I knew, could I? By the way, thank you for the pineapple. You're quite right, it is my favorite. But how did you know?

Tom Riddle:
[Thinks of a response] Intuition.

Horace Slughorn:
[Smiles, then looks at a clock that has gone off] Good gracious, is it that time, already? Off you go, boys, or Professor Dippet will have us all in detention. [Everyone but Tom leaves. Tom taps the hourglass, and Slughorn notices Tom is still there] Look sharp, Tom. Don't want to be caught out of bed after hours. Is something on your mind, Tom?

Tom Riddle:
Yes, sir. You see, I couldn't think of anyone else to go to. The other professors, well, they're not like you. They might misunderstand.

Horace Slughorn:
Go on.

Tom Riddle:
[Approaching Slughorn] I was in the library the other day, in the Restricted Section, and I read something rather odd about a bit of rare magic, and I thought, perhaps, you could illuminate me. It's called, as I understand it... [He makes an unintelligible sound and Slughorn stares in bewilderment.]

Horace Slughorn:
I beg your pardon? I don't know anything about such things and if I did, I wouldn't tell you! Now get out of here at once AND DON'T EVER LET ME CATCH YOU MENTIONING IT AGAIN! [The memory becomes cloudy and ends]

Ron:
[under the effect of a love potion, fawning over Romilda Vane] I'm in love with her!

Harry:
All right, fine, you're in love with her. Have you ever actually met her?

Ron:
[Realizing] No. [Excitedly] Could you introduce me?

Lavender Brown:
(noticing Hermione at Ron's side in the Hospital Wing) What's she doing here!?

Hermione:
I might ask you the same question!

Lavender:
I happen to be his girlfriend!

Hermione:
I happen to be his... friend.

Lavender:
Don't make me laugh. You haven't spoken in weeks! I suppose you want to make up now that he's suddenly all interesting!

Hermione:
He's been poisoned, you daft dimbo! And for the record, I've always found him interesting.

[Ron stirs]

Lavender Brown:
Ah! See? He senses my presence. [leans down] Don't worry, Won-Won! I'm here. I'm here.

Ron Weasley:
[croaks] Uh... Hermione... Her... my... nee. Hermione...

[Hermione tenderly takes Ron's hand. Lavender runs out in tears. Awkward silence.]

Albus Dumbledore:
[jovially] Oh, to be young and to feel love's keen sting. Well, come away everyone... Mr. Weasley is well tended.

[They all leave]

Ginny:
(whispering to Harry) About time, too. Don't you think?

Harry:
(To Madam Pomfrey as she puts something on Ron's bedside table) Thank you.

Hermione:
(noticing Harry's expression) Oh, shut up.

(Harry leaves as Hermione continues to clutch Ron's hand and smile tenderly at him.)

[Harry emerges from a corner hiding from Draco who turns sharply]

Harry:
Sectumsempra

[The spell hits Draco who gets knocked aside. Harry then looks at Draco who lies on the floor bleeding. Snape then appears before Draco and presses his wand into Draco's wounds]

Snape:
Vulnera Sanentur [as he speaks the wounds inflicted by Harry heal]

[Slughorn is snipping tentacular leaves through a window in the greenhouse. Harry, who is walking by, notices Slughorn and walks up behind him, startling him.]

Horace Slughorn:
[Gasps in surprise] Merlin's beard, Harry!

Harry Potter:
Oh, sorry, sir, I should've announced myself. Cleared my throat. Coughed. You probably feared I was Professor Sprout!

Horace Slughorn:
Yes, I did actually! ...What made you think that?

Harry Potter:
Oh, well, just the general behavior, sir - the sneaking around, jumping when you saw me... Are those tentacular leaves, sir? They're very valuable, aren't they?

Horace Slughorn:
Ten Galleons a leaf to the right buyer! ...Not that I'm familiar with any such back alley transactions, but one does hear rumors. My own interests are purely academic, of course.

Harry Potter:
Personally, these plants always kind of freak me out.

[Harry says he is in a hurry to get to Hagrid's and says he must go]

Horace Slughorn:
[Astounded] HARRY!

Harry Potter:
[Similarly] Sir?

[Slughorn pursues Harry, under the influence of Felix Felicis, across the grounds.]

Horace Slughorn:
Harry, I must insist you accompany me back to the castle immediately!

Harry Potter:
That would be counter-productive, sir!

Horace Slughorn:
What makes you say that?

Harry Potter:
No idea.

Horace Slughorn:
[Seeing Aragog's corpse] Merlin's beard! Is that an actual Acromantula?

Harry Potter:
A dead one, I think, sir.

Horace Slughorn:
[To Hagrid] Dear man, however did you manage to kill it?!

[Trying to persuade Slughorn, who is drunk, to divulge his true memory]

Harry:
I'm going to tell you something - something others have only guessed at. It's true. I am the Chosen One, only I can destroy him, but in order to do so, I need to know what Tom Riddle asked you all those years ago in your office, and I need to know what you told him. Be brave, sir. Be brave like my mother. Otherwise you disgrace her. Otherwise she died for nothing. Otherwise the bowl will remain empty, forever.

Slughorn:
Please... don't think badly of me when you see it. You've no idea how he was like, even then. [Withdraws memory]

[Harry watches Slughorn's real memory, which starts with Tom tapping the hourglass]

Tom Riddle:
[approaching Slughorn] I was in the library the other day, in the Restricted Section, and I read something rather odd about a bit of rare magic. It's called, as I understand it... a Horcrux.

Horace Slughorn:
I beg your pardon?

Tom Riddle:
A Horcrux. I came across the term while reading and I didn't fully understand it.

Horace Slughorn:
I'm not sure what you were reading, Tom, but this is very dark stuff. Very dark indeed.

Tom Riddle:
Which is why I came to you.

Horace Slughorn:
[Stares at Tom for a second] A Horcrux is an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul.

Tom Riddle:
But I don't understand how that works, sir.

Horace Slughorn:
One splits ones soul and hides part of it in an object. By doing so, you are protected, should you be attacked and your body destroyed.

Tom Riddle:
Protected?

Horace Slughorn:
That part of your soul that is hidden lives on. In other words, you cannot die.

Tom Riddle:
[Looks into the fireplace] And how does one split his soul, sir?

Horace Slughorn:
I think you already know the answer to that, Tom.

Tom Riddle:
Murder.

Horace Slughorn:
Yes. Killing rips the soul apart. It's a violation against nature.

Tom Riddle:
[Adjusting ring on his finger, the same one in present day Dumbledore's office] Can you only split the soul once? For instance, isn't seven...

Horace Slughorn:
Seven? Merlin's beard, Tom! Isn't it bad enough to consider killing one person? To rip the soul into seven pieces... This is all hypothetical, isn't it, Tom? All academic?

Tom Riddle:
[Smiling] Of course, sir. It'll be our little secret.

[Memory goes cloudy and ends]

Albus Dumbledore:
Good evening, Draco. What brings you here on this fine, spring evening?

Draco Malfoy:
Who else is here? I heard you talking.

Albus Dumbledore:
I often talk aloud to myself. I find it extraordinarily useful. Have you been whispering to you yourself, Draco? Draco, you are no assassin.

Draco Malfoy:
How do you know what I am?! I've done things that would shock you!

Albus Dumbledore:
Like cursing Katie Bell and hoping that, in return, she would bear a cursed necklace to me? Like replacing a bottle of mead with one laced with poison? Forgive me, Draco, but I cannot help feeling these actions are so weak that your heart couldn't really be in them.

Draco Malfoy:
He trusts me! I was chosen! [reveals the Dark Mark on his left arm]

Albus Dumbledore:
I shall make it easy for you... [raises his wand]

Draco Malfoy:
Expelliarmus!

Albus Dumbledore:
[wand flies out of his hand] Very good, very good. [door opens in the distance] You're not alone? There are others? How?

Draco Malfoy:
The Vanishing Cabinet in the Room of Requirement. I've been mending it.

Albus Dumbledore:
Let me guess; It has a sister? A twin?

Draco Malfoy:
At Borgin & Burke's. They form a passage.

Albus Dumbledore:
Ingenius. Draco, years ago, I knew a boy who made all the wrong choices. Please let me help you.

Draco Malfoy:
[breaking into tears] I don't want your help! Don't you understand? I have to do this! I have to kill you! Or he's going to kill me...

Bellatrix Lestrange:
[walking into the astronomy tower followed by Death Eaters] Well, look what we have here. Well done, Draco!

Albus Dumbledore:
Good evening, Bellatrix. I think introductions are called for.

Bellatrix Lestrange:
Love to, Albus, but I'm afraid we're on a bit of a tight schedule. [to Draco] Do it!

Fenrir Greyback:
He doesn't have the stomach... just like his father. Let me finish him in my own way.

Bellatrix Lestrange:
No! The Dark Lord was clear; The boy's to do it. This is your moment. Do it! Go on, Draco! NOW!

Severus Snape:
No. [steps in]

Albus Dumbledore:
Severus... please.

[short pause]

Severus Snape:
Avada Kedavra!

[The spell hits Dumbledore. He is knocked over the rail behind him and falls from the tower]

Harry Potter:
Incarcerous! [Snape blocks the spell] Fight back! You coward, fight back!

[Bellatrix knocks Harry backwards with a spell]

Severus Snape:
No! He belongs to the Dark Lord!

[Bellatrix reluctantly walks away. Snape glances at Harry briefly before beginning to leave.]

Harry Potter:
Sectumsempra!

[Snape knocks Harry backwards, then approaches him slowly]

Severus Snape:
You dare use my own spells against me, Potter? [Harry stares in horror] Yes. I'm the Half-Blood Prince. [Kicks Harry's wand away and leaves]

[Harry Potter enters the Headmaster's office alone and watches everything, Minerva McGonagall enters to tell Harry]

Minerva McGonagall:
Potter... In light of what has happened. If you should have the need to talk to someone... You should know, Professor Dumbledore... You meant a great deal to him.

[Next scene, in the Astronomy Tower with Harry, Ron and Hermione]

Hermione Granger:
Do you think he would've done it? Draco.

Harry Potter:
No. No, he was lowering his wand. In the end, it was Snape. It was always Snape. I did nothing. [Harry gives the locket to Hermione] It's fake. Open it.

Hermione Granger:
[opens the locket and reads the message] To the Dark Lord: I know I will be dead long before you read this but I want you to know that it was I who discovered your secret. I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can. I face death in the hope that when you meet your match, you will be mortal once more. R.A.B. R.A.B.?

Harry Potter:
Don't know. But whoever they are, they have the real Horcrux. It means it was all a waste. All of it.

Hermione Granger:
Ron's okay with you, you know. You and Ginny. If I were you when he's around, I'd keep snogging to a minimum.

Harry Potter:
I'm not coming back, Hermione. I got to finish whatever Dumbledore started. And I don't know where that'll leave me, but I'll let you and Ron know where I am... when I can.

Hermione Granger:
I've always admired your courage, Harry. But sometimes, you can be really thick. You don't really think you're going to be able to find all those Horcruxes by yourself, do you? You need us, Harry.

Harry Potter:
I never realized how beautiful this place was.


Albus Dumbledore:
Soon we must all face the choice between what is right and what is easy.

Albus Dumbledore:
This year Hogwarts will play host to a legendary event: the Triwizard Tournament. During which time a single student gets to represent his or her school in a series of magical contests. Eternal glory awaits the student who wins the tournament.

Albus Dumbledore:
Harry, did you put your name in the Goblet of Fire?

Harry Potter:
No sir!

Albus Dumbledore:
Did you ask one of the older students to do it for you?

Harry Potter:
No sir.

Albus Dumbledore:
Are you absolutely sure?

Harry Potter:
Yes sir.

Malfoy:
Why so tense, Potter? My father and I have a bet, you see. I don't think you're going to last ten minutes in this tournament. He disagrees. He thinks you won't last five!

Harry:
I don't give a damn what your father thinks, Malfoy! He's vile and cruel, and you're just pathetic!

Hermione Granger:
Harry.

Harry Potter:
Ah.

Hermione Granger:
Harry! You alright?

Harry Potter:
Hermione! Bad dream. When did you get here?

Hermione Granger:
Just now, you?

Harry Potter:
Last night.

Hermione Granger:
Wake up! Wake up, Ronald!

Ron Weasley:
Bloody hell!

Hermione Granger:
Honestly get dressed! And don't go back to sleep. Come on, Ron! Your mother says breakfast is ready.

Harry Potter:
Ron, where are we actually going?

Ron Weasley:
Don’t know. Hey, Dad! Where are we going?

Arthur Weasley:
Haven’t the foggiest!

Ron Weasley:
[walking to the Top Box] Blimey, Dad! How far up are we?

Lucius Malfoy:
[standing below them] Well, put it this way; If it rains, you’ll be the first to know.

Draco Malfoy:
Father and I are in the Minister's box. A personal invitation from Cornelius Fudge himself!

Lucius Malfoy:
Don't boast, Draco. [nudges him with his stick] There is no need with these people. [to Harry] Do enjoy yourself won't you? While you can.

Ginny:
[pointing at a particularly showy Quidditch player] Who is that?

Fred/George:
That, sis, is the best seeker in the world!

Everyone:
KRUM!!!

[Professor Moody's first lesson]

Barty Crouch Jr.:
(as Mad-Eye) Alastor Moody. [Writes his name on the board] Ex-Auror... Ministry malcontent... and your new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. I'm here because Dumbledore asked me. End of story, good-bye, the end. Any questions? [No one raises their hand] When it comes to the Dark Arts, I believe in a practical approach. But first, who can tell me how many Unforgivable Curses there are?

Hermione:
Three, sir.

Crouch (as Mad-Eye):
[Writes Unforgiveable on a blackboard] And they are so named?

Hermione:
Because they are unforgivable. The use of any one of them will...

Crouch (as Mad-Eye):
[finishing her sentence] Will earn you a one-way ticket to Azkaban. Correct. Now, the Ministry says you're too young to see what these curses do. I SAY DIFFERENT! You need to know what you're up against! You need to be prepared! [Seamus takes some gum out and puts it under his desk] You need to find another place to put your chewing gum besides the under-side of your desk, MR. FINNIGAN!

Seamus Finnigan:
[Whispering] No way. The old codger can see out the back of his head.

Crouch (as Mad-Eye):
[Throws the piece of chalk at Seamus] AND HEAR ACROSS CLASSROOMS! So, which curse shall we see first? WEASLEY!

Ron:
[scared out of his wits] Yes?

Crouch (as Mad-Eye):
Stand! Give us a curse.

Ron:
Well, my dad did tell me about one. The Imperius Curse.

Crouch (as Mad-Eye):
Oh, yeah. Your father would know all about that. Gave the Ministry a bit of grief a few years ago. Perhaps this will show you why.

[Crouch has just finished his Imperius Curse demonstration on an enlarged spider by sending it flying around the classroom]

Crouch (as Mad-Eye):
Scores of witches and wizards have claimed that they only did You-Know-Who's bidding...under the influence of the Imperius Curse. But here's the rub: How do we sort out the liars? Another, another. [Students begin to raise their hands] Up, come on. [Neville slowly raises his hand] Longbottom, is it? [Neville lowers his hand and stands up] Professor Sprout tells me you have an aptitude for Herbology.

Neville:
[Nervously] There's the, um, the Cruciatus Curse.

Crouch (as Mad-Eye):
Correct! Correct! Come, come. [the spider comes back] Particularly nasty. The torture curse. [Aims his wand at the spider] Crucio!

[The spider makes a terrifying squealing sound, seriously bothering Neville, who is watching it up close]

Hermione:
Stop it! Can't you see it's bothering him?! Stop it!

Crouch (as Mad-Eye):
[Releases the spider from the curse; Walks over and places the spider on Hermione's desk] Perhaps you could give us the last Unforgivable curse, Miss Granger. [Hermione shakes her head] No? [Points his wand at the spider] Avada Kedavra! [The spider falls, unmarked but dead. Harry is watching from a desk across.] The Killing Curse. [looks at Harry] Only one person is known to have survived it...and he's sitting in this room.

Olympe Maxime:
It's wrong, I tell you!

Igor Karkaroff:
You French tart! Everything is a conspiracy theory with you!

Albus Dumbledore:
Quiet! I can't think!

Karkaroff:
Everything is a conspiracy theory!

Maxime:
I protest!

Dumbledore:
Harry!

Maxime:
I protest!

Dumbledore:
Harry. [Grabs him] Did you put your name in the Goblet of Fire?

Harry:
No, sir!

Dumbledore:
Did you ask one of the older students to do it for you?

Harry:
No, sir!

Dumbledore:
You're absolutely sure?

Harry:
Yes. Yes, sir.

Maxime:
But of course he is lying!

Barty Crouch Jr. (as Mad-Eye Moody):
The hell he is! The Goblet of Fire is an exceptionally powerful magical object. Only an exceptionally powerful Confundus Charm could have hoodwinked it. Magic way beyond the talents of a fourth year.

Karkaroff:
You seem to have given this a fair bit of thought, Mad-Eye.

Crouch (as Mad-Eye):
[threateningly] It was once my job to think as dark wizards do, Karkaroff. Perhaps you remember.

Dumbledore:
[enraged, walking between them] This doesn't help, Alastor! [to Barty Sr.] Leave this to you, Barty.

Barty Crouch, Sr.:
The rules are absolute. The Goblet of Fire constitutes a binding magical contract. Mr. Potter has no choice. He is, as of tonight... a Triwizard champion.

Minerva McGonagall:
This can't go on, Albus. First the Dark Mark, now this?

Dumbledore:
What do you suggest, Minerva?

McGonagall:
Put an end to it. Don't let Potter compete.

Dumbledore:
You heard Barty. The rules are clear.

McGonagall:
Well, the devil with Barty - and his rules. And since when did you accommodate the Ministry?

Severus Snape:
Headmaster, I too find it difficult to believe this mere coincidence. However, if we are to truly discover the meaning of these events, perhaps we should, for the time being... let them unfold.

McGonagall:
What? Do nothing? Offer him up as bait? Potter is a boy, not a piece of meat!

Dumbledore:
I agree... with Severus. Alastor, keep an eye on Harry, will you?

Crouch (as Mad-Eye):
I can do that.

Dumbledore:
Don't let him know, though. He must be anxious enough as it is... knowing what lies ahead. Then again, we all are.

[Rita Skeeter is interviewing Harry in a broom cupboard]

Rita Skeeter:
This is cozy.

Harry:
It's a broom cupboard.

Rita:
You should feel right at home then. [Forces Harry to a lower part of the cupboard] Don't mind if I use a Quick-Quotes Quill, do you?

Harry:
Oh. Uh, no.

Rita:
So tell me, Harry. Here you sit, a mere boy of twelve--

Harry:
I'm fourteen. Sorry.

Rita:
About to compete against three students, not only vastly more emotionally mature than yourself, but to have mastered spells you wouldn't attempt in your dizziest daydreams. Concerned?

Harry:
I-I don't know. I haven't really thought about it. [looks at the quill, which is writing on its own]

Rita:
Just ignore the quill. Then, of course, you're no ordinary boy of twelve, are you?

Harry:
[miffed] Fourteen.

Rita:
Your story's legend. Do you think it was the trauma of your past that made you so keen to enter such a dangerous tournament?

Harry:
I didn't enter.

Rita:
Of course you didn't. Everyone loves a rebel, Harry. [To the quill] Scratch that last. [the quill obeys] Speaking of your parents, were they alive, how do you think they'd feel? Proud? Or concerned that your attitude shows, at best a pathological need for attention, at worst a psychotic death wish?

Harry:
[looks at the quill's notes] Hey! My eyes aren't glistening with the ghosts of my past!

Harry:
Sirius. How–?

Sirius:
I don't have much time, Harry, so let me get straight to it. Did you or did you not put your name into the Goblet of Fire?

Harry:
No!

Sirius:
Shh! I had to ask. Now tell me about this dream of yours. You mentioned Wormtail and Voldemort, but who was the third man in the room?

Harry:
I don't know.

Sirius:
You didn't hear a name?

Harry:
No. Voldemort was giving him a job to do. Something important.

Sirius:
And what was that?

Harry:
He wanted... me. I don't know why, but he was gonna use this man to get to me. But, I mean, it was only a dream, right?

Sirius:
Yes... it's just a dream. Look, Harry, the Death Eaters at the World Cup; your name rising from that goblet; these are not just coincidences. Hogwarts isn't safe anymore.

Harry:
What are you saying?

Sirius:
I'm saying the devils are inside the walls. Igor Karkaroff? He was a Death Eater and no one, not one stops being a Death Eater. Then there's Barty Crouch, heart of stone, sent his own son to Azkaban.

Harry:
Do you think one of them put my name in the goblet?

Sirius:
I haven't a clue who put your name in that goblet, Harry, but whoever did is no friend to you. People die in this tournament.

Harry:
I'm not ready for this, Sirius.

Sirius:
You don't have a choice.

Harry:
Someone's coming.

Sirius:
Keep your friends close, Harry.

[Hermione is delivering a message from Ron to Harry, since neither of them are speaking to each other]

Hermione:
Ronald would like me to tell you that Seamus told him that Dean was told by Parvati that Hagrid is looking for you.

Harry:
Is that right? Well... You can tell him... Wait... What?

Hermione:
[Goes back to Ron, talks to him quietly for a few seconds, then walks back] Dean was told by Parvati that... that... Please don't ask me to say it again! Hagrid is looking for you. [starts to walk away]

Harry:
Well you can tell Ronald–

Hermione:
[furiously] I'M NOT AN OWL!

Draco Malfoy:
Why so tense, Potter? My father and I have a bet, you see. I don't think you're gonna last ten minutes in this tournament. He disagrees. He thinks you won't last five! [laughs]

Harry:
[enraged] I don't give a damn what your father thinks, Malfoy! He's vile, and cruel... and you're just pathetic.

Draco:
Pathetic?! [angrily draws his wand]

Crouch (as Mad-Eye):
OH NO, YOU DON'T, SONNY! [Transfigures Draco into a ferret] I'll teach you to curse someone when their back is turned! [Proceeds to flick the ferret up and down] You stinking...cowardly...scummy...back-shooting--

McGonagall:
Professor Moody! Wha-what are you doing?!

Crouch (as Mad-Eye):
Teaching.

McGonagall:
[shocked] Is that a... Is that a student?!

Crouch (as Mad-Eye):
Technically, it's a ferret. [Proceeds to dump the ferret down Crabbe's trousers]

Goyle:
Stand still! Stand still! [Attempts to remove the ferret from Crabbe's trousers, only to be bitten]

[Crouch turns around and winks at Harry, who is laughing gleefully. The ferret crawls out of Crabbe's trousers, and McGonagall turns Draco back into his normal human self]

Draco:
[Getting up] My father will hear about this!

Crouch (as Mad-Eye):
Is that a threat?

[Draco turns and runs]

McGonnagall:
Professor Moody--

Crouch (as Mad-Eye):
IS THAT A THREAT?!

McGonnagall:
Professor--

Crouch (as Mad-Eye):
I CAN TELL YOU STORIES ABOUT YOUR FATHER THAT WILL CURL EVEN YOUR GREASY HAIR, BOY!

McGonnagall:
Alastor!

Crouch (as Mad-Eye):
IT DOESN'T END HERE!

McGonagall:
Alastor. [Moody listens] We never use Transfiguration as a punishment! Surely, Dumbledore told you that?

Crouch (as Mad-Eye):
He might've mentioned it.

McGonagall:
Well, you will do well to remember it. [She turns around, before gesturing a group of students gathered nearby to leave] Away!

[As McGonagall walks away, Crouch sticks his tongue out at her, behind her back]

Crouch (as Mad-Eye):
You. Come with me.

Ron:
I reckon you'd have to be barking mad to put your name in the Goblet of Fire.

Harry:
Caught on, have you? Took you long enough.

Ron:
Well, I'm the not only who thought you'd done it. Everyone was saying it behind your back.

[Harry glares around the room; the others sheepishly avoid his eyes.]

Harry:
[sarcastic] Brilliant. That makes me feel loads better.

Ron:
Least I warned you about the dragons.

Harry:
Hagrid warned me about the dragons.

Ron:
No, no, no. I did. No, don't you remember? I told Hermione to tell you that Seamus told me that Parvati told Dean that Hagrid was looking for you, Seamus never actually told me anything, so it was really me all along. I thought we'd be all right, you know, after you'd figured that out.

Harry:
[confused] ...Who? Who could possibly figure that out? That's completely mental.

Ron:
Yeah. Isn't it? I suppose I was a bit distraught.

Hermione:
[sadly] Boys.

McGonagall:
The house of Godric Gryffindor has been a beacon in the wizarding world for nearly ten centuries, and I will not have you besmirching it in one night by acting like a babbling, bumbling band of baboons.

George/Fred:
[to each other] Try saying that five times fast. [together] Babbling, bumbling band of baboons! Babbling, bumbling band of baboons! Babbling... [Both walk off screen]

McGonagall:
[About the Yule Ball] Inside every girl, a secret swan slumbers, longing to burst forth and take flight.

Ron:
[To Seamus] Something's about to burst out of Eloise Midgen, but I don't think it's a swan.

[McGonagall is teaching the group how to dance by dancing with Ron]

Harry:
[To Fred and George]] Oi! [They lean in to him] You're never gonna let him forget this, are you?

Both:
[smug smirks on their faces] Never.

[Ron and Harry are dressed up for the Yule Ball; Harry has on much more flattering robes whilst Ron's are hideous.]

Ron:
What are those?! What are those?!

Harry:
My dress robes.

Ron:
Well, they're all right! No lace, no dodgy little collar...

Harry:
Well, I expect yours are more... traditional—

Ron Traditional?! They're ancient! I look like my Great Aunt Tessie. [sniffs clothing in armpit area] I smell like my Great Aunt Tessie! [They look in the mirror] Murder me, Harry.

Parvati:
[Looking at Hermione] She looks beautiful!

Harry:
[Looking at Cho] Yeah, she does... Wha– [Turns around and sees Hermione coming down the stairs. Noticing how beautiful she really looks, he smiles gently, agreeing with Parvati]

Dumstrang Boy:
[To Parvati] May I have your arm?

Parvati:
[looks back at Harry then says to the boy] Arm? Leg? I'm yours! [goes to dance with him]

[Hermione is Krum's date at the Yule Ball; Ron is clearly jealous]

Ron:
[about Krum] He’s using you.

Hermione:
How dare you! Besides, I can take care of myself.

Ron:
Doubt it, he’s way too old.

Hermione:
What? Is that what you think?

Ron:
Yeah, that’s what I think!

Hermione:
[on the verge of tears] You know the solution then, don’t you?

Ron:
Go on.

Hermione:
Next time there’s a ball, pluck up the courage and ask me before somebody else does, and not as a last resort!

Ron:
Well... that-that-that... that’s just completely off the point. [sees Harry approaching] Harry.

Hermione:
Where have you been? Never mind. Off to bed, both of you!

Ron:
They get scary when they get older.

Hermione:
Ron, you spoiled EVERYTHING!! [Breaks down in tears on the stairs]

[Hermione and Harry are talking about the egg from the first task]

Harry:
I suppose Viktor's already figured it out.

Hermione:
[catching on his meaning] Wouldn't know, we don't actually talk about the tournament. Actually, we don't really talk at all. Viktor's more of a physical being.

[They both start laughing at this Freudian slip]

Hermione:
[desperately trying to recover] I just mean he's not particularly loquacious. [Harry looks at her in amusement] Mostly, he watches me study. It's a bit annoying, actually.

[Harry had just eaten the Gillyweed and is developing finned feet and hands and gills underwater. On the docks, Neville, Dean and Seamus are watching what is happening underwater]

Seamus:
What's the matter with him?

Dean:
I don't know. I can't see him.

Neville[horrified]:
Oh my God! I've killed Harry Potter!

[Harry was given a towel to dry up, when Fleur and her sister, Gabrielle, both rush up to him]

Fleur Delacour:
You saved her, even though she was not yours to save. My little sister. Thank you! [kisses Harry on both cheeks before turning to Ron] And you, you helped.

Ron:
Yeah, yeah, a bit. [Fleur kisses Ron on both cheeks as well before checking on her little sister] Merci.

[Harry has just finished the second task and Hermione has given him her blanket. Harry had rescued Fleur's little sister]

Hermione:
Personally, I believe you behaved admirably.

Harry:
I finished last, Hermione.

[Hermione kisses him on the head]

Hermione:
Next to last. Fleur never got past ze Grindylows.

[Harry is in a memory of Dumbledore's using the pensieve]

Bartemius Crouch Sr.:
Igor Karkaroff, you have been brought from Azkaban at your own request to present evidence to this council. Should your testimony prove consequential, Council may be prepared to order your immediate release. Until such time you remain, in the eyes of the Ministry, a convicted Death Eater. Do you accept these terms?

Igor Karkaroff:
I do, sir.

Bartemius Crouch Sr.:
And what do you wish to present?

Igor Karkaroff:
I have names, sir. There was a Rosier, Evan Rosier.

Bartemius Crouch Sr.:
Mr. Rosier is dead.

Igor Karkaroff:
Dead?

Alastor Moody:
[to Dumbledore] Yeah, he took a piece of me with him, though, didn't he?

Igor Karkaroff:
I didn't know.

Bartemius Crouch Sr.:
If that is all the witness has to offer...

Igor Karkaroff:
No! No! There was Rookwood, he was a spy.

Bartemius Crouch Sr.:
Augustus Rookwood? Of the Department of Mysteries?

Igor Karkaroff:
Ya ya, the same. He passed information to You-Know-Who from inside the Ministry itself.

Bartemius Crouch Sr.:
Very well, the council will deliberate. In the meantime you will return to Azkaban.

Igor Karkaroff:
NO! WAIT! WAIT! PLEASE! PLEASE!. I have more! What about Snape, Severus Snape?

Dumbledore:
The council is very much aware of given evidence to this matter. Severus Snape was indeed a Death Eater, and prior to Lord Voldemort's downfall turned spy for us at great personal risk. Today he's no more a Death Eater than I am.

Igor Karkaroff:
[with demented fury] It's a lie! Severus Snape remains faithful to the Dark Lord!

Bartemius Crouch Sr.:
Silence! Unless the witness possesses any genuine name of consequence, this session is now concluded.

Igor Karkaroff:
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I heard about one more.

Bartemius Crouch Sr.:
What's that?

Igor Karkaroff:
The name...

Bartemius Crouch Sr.:
Yes?

Igor Karkaroff:
I know for a fact that this person took part in the capture, and by means of the Cruciatus curse, torture of the Auror Frank Longbottom and his wife...

[Barty Crouch Jr. stands up and starts to leave]

Bartemius Crouch Sr.:
The name. Give me the wretched name!

Igor Karkaroff:
Barty Crouch! [Rita Skeeter gasps, pause] Junior.

[Barty Crouch Jr. tries to escape, but is stunned by Alastor Moody, and courtroom officials restrain him]

Barty Crouch Jr.:
Get your filthy hands off of me, you pathetic little men! [He is brought before his father] Hello, father. [flicks his tongue]

Bartemius Crouch Sr.:
[visibly hurt] You are no son of mine.

[Barty Crouch Jr. licks his lips, then screams with rage. He lunges at his father, only to be held back.]

Harry Potter:
[To Ron] I didn't put my name in that cup. I don't want eternal glory. I just want to be– Look. I don't know what happened tonight and I don't know why. It just did. Okay?

Harry Potter:
[To Ron] You're a right foul git, you know that?

Harry Potter:
[To Draco] I don't give a damn what your father thinks, Malfoy! He's vile, and cruel– and you're just pathetic.

Harry Potter:
[On attempting to ask girls out] Why do they have to travel in packs? And how are you supposed to get one alone long enough to ask them?

Harry Potter:
I had a dream about him. It was in the summer, before school. In the dream, I was in a house. And Voldemort was there. Only, he wasn't quite human. And Wormtail was there too. And Mr. Crouch's son.

Harry Potter:
Cedric, we have to get back to the cup, now!

Harry Potter:
[Watching Cedric getting killed] NO! CEDRIC!

Harry Potter:
He's back! He's back! Voldemort's back! Cedric, he asked me to bring his body back. I couldn't leave him– not there!

Harry Potter:
[To Barty Crouch Jr. disguised as Mad-Eye Moody] It was you from the beginning. You put my name in the Goblet of Fire. You bewitched Krum but–

Ron Weasley:
Bloody hell.

Ron Weasley:
Loads. According to dad. It's what worried them so much. Happened right under their noses.

Ron Weasley:
Murder me, Harry.

Ron Weasley:
[bitterly] That's me. Ron Weasley, Harry Potter's stupid friend.

Ron Weasley:
Piss off.

Ron Weasley:
This is mad. At this rate, we'll be the only ones in our year without dates.

Hermione Granger:
[To Harry] Go on, Harry. Harry, for goodness sake.

Hermione Granger:
[To Harry] I'm not an owl!

Hermione Granger:
[Reading a blurb on a copy of the Daily Prophet; miffed] Look at this! I can't believe it. She's done it again. Miss Granger, a plain but ambitious girl, seems to be developing a taste for famous wizards. Her latest prey, sources report, is none other than the Bulgarian bon-bon Viktor Krum. No word yet on how Harry Potter's taking this latest emotional blow.

Hermione Granger:
I won't be going alone, because believe it or not, someone's asked me! And I said yes!

Hermione Granger:
[To Ron] Next time there's a ball, pluck up the courage and ask me before somebody else does! And not as a last resort!

Hermione Granger:
[Ron Weasley: They get scary when get older.] Ron, you spoiled everything!!

Lord Voldemort:
How fastidious you've become, Wormtail. As I recall, you once called the nearest gutter pipe home. Could it be that the task of nursing me has become wearisome enough for you?

Lord Voldemort:
Nagini tells me the old Muggle caretaker is standing just outside the door. Step aside, Wormtail, so I can give our guest a proper greeting. AVADA KEDAVRA!

Lord Voldemort:
Harry, at last!

Lord Voldemort:
Kill the spare.

Lord Voldemort:
The other arm, Wormtail.

Lord Voldemort:
[The Death Eaters appear] Welcome, my friends. Thirteen years it's been, and yet, here you stand before me, as though it were only yesterday. I confess myself... disappointed. Not one of you tried to find me. [He unmasks the Death Eaters one by one and as he does they fall to their knees] Crabbe! Macnair! Goyle! Not even you, Lucius. [He pulls off Lucius' mask who falls to his knees]

Lord Voldemort:
Harry. Oh, I'd almost forgotten you were here. Standing on the bones of my father. I'd introduce you, but word has it you're almost as famous as me these days. The Boy-Who-Lived. How lies have fed your legend, Harry! Shall I reveal what really happened that night thirteen years ago? Shall I divulge how I truly lost my powers? Yes, shall I? It was love. You see, when dear, sweet Lily Potter gave her life for her only son, she provided the ultimate protection. I could not touch him. It was old magic. Something I should have foreseen. But no matter, no matter. Things have changed. I CAN TOUCH YOU NOW! [He places his finger on Harry's forehead lightning bolt scar, and Harry immediately screams out in agony, to Voldemort's cruel delight] Astonishing what a few drops of your blood will do, eh, Harry?

Lord Voldemort:
(as he roughly releases the scythe) Pick up your wand, Potter! I said, pick it up! Get up! Get up! (Harry gets his wand) You've been taught how to duel, I presume, yes? First, we bow to each other. (he bows, Harry does not) Come on now, Harry. The niceties must be observed. Dumbledore wouldn't want you to forget your manners, would he? I said, BOW! (uses a curse to make Harry bow) That's better, and now: Crucio! (Harry writhes on the grass in pain) Crucio! (the curse goes away) Attaboy, Harry! Your parents would be proud. Especially your filthy Muggle mother!

Lord Voldemort:
I'm going to kill you, Harry Potter. I'm going to destroy you. (leans down to meet Harry's eyes) After tonight, no one will ever again question my powers. After tonight, if they speak of you, they'll speak only of how you begged for death... and I, being a merciful Lord, obliged. Get up! (Harry groans)

Lord Voldemort:
(as he fires the Killing Curse at the tombstone; shouting) Don't you turn your back on me, Harry Potter! I want you to look at me when I kill you! I WANT TO SEE THE LIGHT LEAVE YOUR EYES!

Lord Voldemort:
[To the onlooking Death Eaters during Priori Incantatem] Do nothing! He's mine to finish!

Albus Dumbledore:
I keep looking for some mistake, some sign, some clue as to why these terrible things are happening, but everytime I get close to an answer, IT SLIPS AWAY, it's maddening.

Albus Dumbledore:
Eternal glory. That is what awaits the student who wins the Triwizard Tournament. But to do this, that student must survive three tasks. Three extremely dangerous tasks.

Albus Dumbledore:
The Goblet of Fire. Anyone wishing to submit themselves to the tournament, need only write their name upon a piece of parchment, and throw it in the flame before this hour on Thursday night. Do no do so lightly. If chosen, there's no turning back. As from this moment, the Triwizard Tournament has begun.

Albus Dumbledore:
Excellent! We now have three champions. But in the end, only one will go down in history. Only one will hoist the chalice of champions this vessel of victory The Triwizard Cup!

Albus Dumbledore:
[Enters the tent of the First Task] Welcome today, champions. Now you've waited, you've wondered, and finally, the moment has arrived. A moment only four of you can fully appreciate. [notices that it's Hermione whose shoulders he has his arm around] What are you doing here, Miss Granger?

Albus Dumbledore:
[In the great hall speaking to the staff and students; his eulogy for Cedric] Today, we acknowledge... a really terrible loss. Cedric Diggory was, as you all know, exceptionally hard-working, infinitely fair-minded, and most importantly, a fierce, fierce friend. Now I think, therefore, you have the right to know exactly how he died. [getting up] You see, Cedric Diggory was murdered, by Lord Voldemort! The Ministry of Magic does not wish me to tell you this, but not to do so, I think, would be an insult to his memory. Now, the pain we all feel at this dreadful loss reminds me... reminds us, that while we may come from different places, and speak in different tongues, our hearts beat as one. In light of recent events, the bonds of friendship we made this year will be more important than ever! You remember that, and Cedric Diggory will not have died in vain. You remember that, and we will celebrate a boy who was kind and honest and fair and true, right to the very end.

Alastor Mad-Eye Moody:
Alastor Moody. Ex-Auror, Ministry malcontent, and your new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. I'm here because Dumbledore asked me. End of story, goodbye, the end. Any questions?

Alastor Mad-Eye Moody:
The Goblet of Fire is an exceptionally powerful magical object. Only an exceptionally powerful Confundus Charm could have hoodwinked it. Magic way beyond the talents of a fourth year. (Igor Karkaroff: You seem to have given this a fair bit of thought, Mad-Eye.) It was once my job to think as dark wizards do, Karkaroff, perhaps you remember.

Alastor Mad-Eye Moody:
That's a Foe-Glass. Let's me keep an eye on my enemies. If I can see the whites of their eyes, they're standing right behind me.

Alastor Mad-Eye Moody:
Wouldn't even bother telling you what's in there. You wouldn't believe it if I did.

Alastor Mad-Eye Moody:
Marvelous creatures, dragons, aren't they?

Alastor Mad-Eye Moody:
BARTEMIUS... not trying lure Potter into one of your summer internships, are we? Last boy that went in the Department of Mysteries never came out.

Alastor Mad-Eye Moody:
[to Harry, about Voldemort] What was it like? What was like to stand in his presence?

Alastor Mad-Eye Moody:
You won because I made it so Potter. You ended up in that graveyard tonight because it was meant to be so. And now the deed is done. The blood that runs through these veins…runs within the Dark Lord.

Alastor Mad-Eye Moody:
Imagine how he will reward me when he learns that I have once and for all silenced the great Harry Potter.

Sirius Black:
Harry, I couldn't risk sending Hedwig. Ever since the World Cup, the Ministry’s been intercepting more and more owls and she’s too easily recognized. We need to talk, Harry, face to face. Meet me in the Gryffindor Common Room, at one o’ clock this Saturday night. And make sure you're alone. Sirius. PS: the bird bites.

Sirius Black:
Look Harry, the death eaters at the world cup, your name rising from that goblet, these aren't just coincidences, Hogwarts isn't safe anymore.

Sirius Black:
I haven't a clue who put your name in that goblet Harry, but whoever did is no friend to you. People die in this tournament.

Sirius Black:
If you want to know what a man's like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.

Hogwarts student #1:
He's a cheat!

Hogwarts student #2:
He's not even 17 yet!

Barty Crouch, Sr.:
The rules are absolute. The Goblet of Fire constitutes a binding magical contract. Mr. Potter has no choice. He is, as of tonight... a Triwizard champion.

Myrtle:
I was circling a blocked drain the other day. I could swear I saw a bit of Polyjuice Potion. (flirtily) Not being a bad boy again, are you, Harry?

Wormtail:
Bone of the father, unwillingly given. (puts the Riddle bone in the cauldron) Flesh of the servant... willingly sacrificed. (screams in agony as he cuts off his own hand) Blood of the enemy... (as he cuts Harry's sleeve and draws blood as Harry screams in pain) forcibly taken. The Dark Lord shall rise again. (adds Harry's blood to the cauldron; it boils and Harry screams)

James Potter:
Harry, when the connection is broken you must get to the Portkey! We can linger for a moment to give you some time but only a moment. Do you understand?

Cedric Diggory:
Harry, take my body back will you? Take my body back to my father.

Lily Potter:
Let go. Sweetheart, you're ready. Let go! LET GO!

Harry Potter:
[talking about the locket Horcrux] Ron, kill it!

Severus Snape:
[from trailer] We have infiltrated the ministry.

Harry Potter:
The longer we stay here, the stronger he gets.

Ron Weasley:
[from trailer] [about Hermione] We wouldn't last two days without her. [pause] Don't tell her I said that.

[after being transformed into Harry]

Fleur Delacour:
Look away, I'm hideous!

Harry Potter:
I thought you knew what you had signed up for!

Ron Weasley:
Yeah, I thought so too

Dobby the House Elf:
[talking about Luna Lovegood] I like her very much.

Hermione Granger:
[from trailer] If Voldemort's really taken over the Ministry, none of the old places are safe.

Ron Weasley:
[from trailer] Don't expect me to get excited over another damn thing we need to find.

Bellatrix Lestrange:
Well, well, well, look what we have here. It's Harry Potter. He's all bright, and shiny, and new again, just in time for the Dark Lord.

Rufus Scrimgeour:
I won't pretend to be your friend, Mr. Potter. But I'm not your enemy.

Harry Potter:
Forgive me minister, but it's a little hard to tell the difference now-a-days.

Xenophilius Lovegood:
[draws a line] The Elder Wand, the most powerful wand ever made. [draws a circle] The Resurrection Stone. [draws a triangle] The Cloak of Invisibility. Together, they make the Deathly Hallows. Together, they make one master of death.

Bellatrix Lestrange:
If this isn't who we think it is Draco and we call him, he'll kill us all.

Lucius Malfoy:
If we are the ones to hand Potter to the Dark Lord, everything will be as it was, you understand?

Alastor 'Mad-Eye' Moody:
[handing out Polyjuice Potion] Fair warning, it tastes like goblin piss.

Fred Weasley:
Have lots of experience with that, do you, Mad-Eye? [Moody glares] Just trying to diffuse the tension.

Pius Thicknesse:
You have nothing to fear, if you have nothing to hide.

Alastor 'Mad-Eye' Moody:
Potter, you're underage. Which means you still have the trace on you.

Harry Potter:
What's the trace?

Alastor 'Mad-Eye' Moody:
If you sneeze, the Ministry will know who wipes your nose. Point is we'll have to use those means of transport the trace can't detect. Brooms, thestrals, anf the like. We'll go in pairs, that way if anyones out there waiting for us, and I reckon there will be, they won't know which Harry Potter is the real one.

Harry Potter:
The real one?

Alastor 'Mad-Eye' Moody:
[Brings out Polyjuice potion] I believe you're familiar with this particular brew.

Harry Potter:
No, absolutely not.

Hermione Granger:
Told you he'd take it well.

Kingsley Shacklebolt:
[pointing his wand at Lupin] The last words that Albus Dumbledore said to the pair of us.

Remus Lupin:
Harry is the best hope we have. Trust him.

Remus Lupin:
We've been betrayed!

Bellatrix Lestrange:
Get Draco.

Kingsley Shacklebolt:
[through his Patronus] The Ministry has fallen. The Minister of Magic is dead. They are coming.

Lord Voldemort:
Where will he be taken, the boy?

Severus Snape:
To a safe house. Most likely the home of someone in the Order. I've been told he's been given every mannerr of protection possible. Once there, it will be impractical to attack him.

Lucius Malfoy:
My Lord?

Lord Voldemort:
[Mockingly] My Lord?

Lord Voldemort:
Severus. I was beginning to worry that you had lost your way. Come, we've saved you a seat. You bring news I trust?

Severus Snape:
It will happen Saturday next, at nightfall.

Yaxley:
I heard differently my Lord. Dawlish, the auror, has let slip that the Potter boy will not be moved until the 30th of this month, the day before he turns 17.

Severus Snape:
This is a false trail. The auror office no longer plays any part in the protection of Harry Potter.

Dolores Umbridge:
You are not a witch.

Dobby the House Elf:
[dying] What a beautiful place... to be with friends.

Fred Weasley:
How you feeling, Georgie?

George Weasley:
...Saint-like.

Fred Weasley:
...Come again?

George Weasley:
Saint-like. [points to ear] I'm holey.

Waitress:
Can I take your order?

Hermione Granger:
I'll have a cappucino.

Waitress:
[turns to Ron] You?

Ron Weasley:
What she said.

Harry Potter:
Same.

[first lines]

Rufus Scrimgeour:
These are dark times, there is no denying. Our world has perhaps faced no greater threat than it does today. But I say this to our citizenry: We, ever your servants, will continue to defend your liberty and repel the forces that seek to take it from you! Your Ministry remains, strong.

Ron Weasley:
[after barely managing to destroy a horcrux] Just think. Only three more to go.

Bellatrix Lestrange:
You stupid elf! You could have killed me!

Dobby the House Elf:
Dobby never meant to kill! Dobby only meant to maim, or seriously injure!

[Hermione is putting on Harry's glasses]

Hermione Granger:
Harry, your eyesight really is awful.

Ron Weasley:
[after saving Harry from drowning] Are you mental?

Harry Potter:
[to Dolores Umbridge just before he Stuns her] You're lying, Dolores... and you mustn't tell lies!

Luna Lovegood:
[after Dobby dies] We should close his eyes. Don't you think?

[Harry nods, she does it]

Luna Lovegood:
There. Now he could be sleeping.

Scabior:
[to a transfigured Harry] What happened to you ugly?

[Harry and Fenrir Greyback turn to him]

Scabior:
[to Fenrir] No, not you.

Fred Weasley, George Weasley:
[after the Seven Potters transformation] Wow, we're identical!

Harry Potter:
This is mental.

Hermione Granger:
Completely mental.

Ron Weasley:
The world's mental.

Dobby the House Elf:
Mr Weasley, so good to see you again!

Ron Weasley:
Wicked trainers.

Bellatrix Lestrange:
[clears throat] My Lord, I'd like to volunteer for this task. I want to kill the boy. [a scream from the cellar interrupts them]

Lord Voldemort:
Wormtail! Have I not spoken to you about keeping our guest quiet?

Wormtail:
Yes, my Lord. Right away, my Lord. [Wormtail scuttles out]

Lord Voldemort:
As inspiring as I find your bloodlust Bellatrix, I must be the one to kill Harry Potter.

Lord Voldemort:
What say you, Pius?

Pius Thicknesse:
One hears many things, my Lord. Which among them is the truth is not clear.

Lord Voldemort:
Ha! Spoken like a true politician. You will, I think, prove most useful, Pius.

Lord Voldemort:
To those of you who do not know: we are joined tonight by Ms. Charity Burbage, who until recently taught at Hogwarts School Of Witchcraft And Wizardry. Her speciality was Muggle Studies. It is Ms. Burbage's belief that Muggles are not so different from us. She would, given her way, have us... mate with them.

Bellatrix Lestrange:
Blech!

Bellatrix Lestrange:
How dare you defy your master!

Dobby the House Elf:
Dobby has no master. Dobby is a free elf, and Dobby has come to save Harry Potter and his friends!

Scabior:
[Hermione walks up] Hello beautiful. [Hermione stops, stares, then backs away] Well, don't just hang in there. Snatch 'em!

Luna Lovegood:
[to her father] Harry doesn't want to talk to us right now. He's just too polite to say so.

Lord Voldemort:
I have seen your heart, and it is mine.

Ron Weasley:
The deluminator. It doesn't just turn off lights. I don't know how it work but Christmas morning, I was sleeping in this little pub, keeping away from some Snatchers, and I heard it. A voice. Your voice, Hermione. You said my name. Just my name. Like a whisper. So I took it, clicked it and this tiny ball of light appeared. And I knew. It flew towards me, the ball of light, right through my chest and straight through me. Right here [he touches his heart] And I knew it was going to take me where I needed to go. [Hermione looks on, breathless]

Hermione Granger:
Actually I'm highly logical which allows me to look past extraneous detail and perceive clearly that which others overlook.

Charity Burbage:
[crying and pleading] Severus, please! We were friends...

Lord Voldemort:
[Snape stares blankly at her. Voldemort raises his wand] Avada Kedavra!

Lord Voldemort:
[Charity's body crashes onto the table. Voldemort caresses Nagini as she slithers across the table] Nagini... dinner.

Ron Weasley:
You don't know why I listen to the radio, do you? To make sure I don't hear Ginny's name. Or Fred, or George, or Mum.

Harry Potter:
You think I'm not listening too? You think I don't know how this feels?

Ron Weasley:
No, you *don't* know how it feels! Your parents are dead! You have no family!

Hermione Granger:
Stop!

Harry Potter:
Fine then, go! Go then!

Hermione Granger:
[Ron wrenches the locket off and gets his bag] Ron...

Ron Weasley:
[turns to Hermione] And you? Are you coming or are you staying? [Hermione looks torn, she glances from Harry to Ron in shock] Fine. I get it. I saw you two the other night.

Hermione Granger:
[tears in her eyes] Ron, that's - that's nothing!

Ron Weasley:
How long do you think she'll stay mad at me?

Harry Potter:
Just keep talking about that little ball of light touching your heart, and she'll come 'round.

Bellatrix Lestrange:
[to Draco] Don't be shy sweetie, come over. Now if this isn't who we think it is, Draco, and we call him, he'll kill us all. We need to be absolutely sure.

Draco Malfoy:
What's wrong with his face?

Bellatrix Lestrange:
Yes, what is wrong with his face?

Scabior:
He came to us like that, something he picked up in the forest I reckon.

Bellatrix Lestrange:
[to Hermione] Or ran into a stinging jinx. Was it you deary? Give me her wand, we'll see what her last spell was. Ah ha, I got you. Ha!

Bellatrix Lestrange:
Cissy, put the boys in the cellar! I'm going to have a conversation with this one, girl to girl.

Bellatrix Lestrange:
[Holding Hermione down] That sword is meant to be in my vault at Gringotts, how did you get it? Did you and your friends take it from my vault?

Hermione Granger:
I didn't take anything. Please. I didn't take anything.

Bellatrix Lestrange:
I don't believe it.

Bellatrix Lestrange:
[to Griphook] Liar! Consider yourself lucky, goblin.

Harry Potter:
[about Ron, after he returns] You're not still mad at him, are you?

Hermione Granger:
I'm always mad at him.

Dobby the House Elf:
[in kitchen, Grimmauld Place] And then Dobby saw Kreacher talking to the thief Mundungus...

Mundungus Fletcher:
[interrupting] I'm not a thief! You foul little... git! I'm a buyer and purveyor of wondrous objects.

Ron Weasley:
You're a thief Dung, everyone knows it!

[last lines]

Harry Potter:
[after Dobby dies] I want to bury him. Properly, without magic.

Ron Weasley:
Hey!

Hermione Granger:
You... complete arse, Ronald Weasley! You show up here after weeks, and you say 'Hey'?

Neville Longbottom:
[the Death Eaters halt the Hogwarts Express and board it]

Neville Longbottom:
[standing defiantly] Hey, losers. He isn't here.

George Weasley:
[while Ginny and Harry kiss] Morning.

Ron Weasley:
[about Hermione's copy of The Tales Of Beedle The Bard] Mum used to read those to me as a kid! The Wizard and the Hopping Pot, Babbity Rabbity And Her Cackling Stump... [Harry and Hermione both look lost] Come on! Babitty Rabbity... No?

Hermione Granger:
[Entering Godric's Hollow] I still think we should have used Polyjuice Potion.

Harry Potter:
No. This is where I was born. I'm not returning as someone else.

Vernon Dursley:
Come on Dudley, hurry up!

Dudley Dursley:
I still don't understand why we have to leave.

Vernon Dursley:
Because, it's not safe for us here anymore.

[Harry, Ron and Hermione infiltrate the Ministry of Magic disguised as Ministry employees]

Yaxley:
Cattermole! It's still raining inside my office!

Ron Weasley:
[trying to disguise his voice] Uh... have you tried an umbrella?

[Preparing to enter the Ministry of Magic]

Ron Weasley:
We have to flush ourselves in! [pause] That's disgusting.

[Tonks and Ron arrive at the Burrow]

Nymphadora Tonks:
Deserves that. Brilliant, he was. Wouldn't be standing here without him.

Hermione Granger:
Really?

Ron Weasley:
Always the tone of surprise.

[after their escape from the Death Eaters]

Ron Weasley:
You're amazing, you are!

Hermione Granger:
[wryly] Always the tone of surprise.

[Harry is about go away from the Weasley house]

Ron Weasley:
Going somewhere?

Harry Potter:
No one else is going to die. Not for me.

Ron Weasley:
For you? You think Mad-Eye died for you? You think George took that curse for you? You may be the Chosen One, mate, but this is a whole lot bigger than that.

Harry Potter:
I don't care about a bloody wedding! No matter whose it is. I have to start searching for the Horcruxes. It's the only chance we have to beat him. And the longer we wait, the stronger he gets.

Ron Weasley:
Tonight's not that night, mate. You'd only be doing him a favor. [pauses] Do you think he knows? I mean, they're bits of his soul. The Horcruxes. Bits of him. When Dumbledore destroyed the ring and you destroyed Tom Riddle's diary all those years ago... He must've felt something, right? What I'm saying is, if we do this thing right, if we find the Horcruxes and begin to destroy them one by one... Won't he know he's being hunted?

Ginny Weasley:
Seems silly, doesn't it? A wedding. Given everything that's going on.

Harry Potter:
Maybe that's the best reason to have it. Because of everything that's going on.

Luna Lovegood:
Hello, Harry! Oh, I've interrupted a deep thought, haven't I? I can see it growing smaller in your eyes.

Harry Potter:
No, of course not. How are you, Luna?

Luna Lovegood:
Very well. I was bitten by a garden gnome only moments ago.

Xenophilius Lovegood:
Gnome saliva is enormously beneficial! Xenophilius Lovegood. [shakes hands with Harry] We live just over the hill!

Harry Potter:
Very nice to meet you, sir.

Xenophilius Lovegood:
I trust you to know, Mr. Potter, that we at the Quibbler, unlike those toadies at the Daily Prophet, fully supported Dumbledore during his lifetime, and his death support you as fully.

Luna Lovegood:
Come, Daddy. Harry doesn't wanna talk to us right now. He's just too polite to say so.

Hermione Granger:
We didn't celebrate your birthday, Harry. Ginny and I... we'd prepared a cake. We were going to bring it out at the end of the wedding.

Harry Potter:
Hermione... I appreciate the thought, honestly. But given that we were almost killed by a couple of Death Eaters a few minutes ago...

[he lets the rest of the sentence remain in the air]

Hermione Granger:
Right. Perspective.

Hermione Granger:
We're alone.

Ron Weasley:
Seems strange, mate. Dumbledore sends you off to find a load of Horcruxes, but doesn't bother to tell you how to destroy them. Doesn't that bother you?

Ron Weasley:
He doesn't know what he's doing, does he?

Hermione Granger:
None of us do.

Hermione Granger:
Oh my god...

Harry Potter:
What?

Hermione Granger:
I'll tell you in a minute.

Harry Potter:
How about you tell me now?

Hermione Granger:
Alright. The Sword of Gryffindor. Maybe it's Goblin made?

Harry Potter:
[points at her with both hands, with heavy irony] Brilliant!

[Harry and Hermione stands at Lily's and James' grave in Godric's Hollow. Hermione sees the tears that streams down his face. She magically leaves a wreath of Christmas roses by it with her wand. Harry stares at them with an emotional face]

Harry Potter:
Merry Christmas, Hermione.

Hermione Granger:
Merry Christmas, Harry.

[Hermione leans her head on his shoulder]

Harry Potter:
It was you!

Ron Weasley:
Well, yeah. Obviously.

Harry Potter:
And the doe. That was you as well.

Ron Weasley:
No. I reckoned it was you.

Harry Potter:
My Patronus is a stag.

Ron Weasley:
Right.

[raising his arms up and fake antlers with his fingers]

Ron Weasley:
Antlers.

Lord Voldemort:
[voiceover as Tom Riddle] I have seen your heart and it's mine. I have seen your dreams, Ronald Weasley, and I have seen your fears...

Harry Potter:
Ron! Don't listen to it!

Lord Voldemort:
[voiceover as Tom Riddle] Least loved by the mother who craved a daughter. Least loved, by the girl who prefers your friend...

Harry Potter:
Ron! Stab it!

Harry Potter:
[as Riddle-Harry] We were better without you, happier without you.

Hermione Granger:
[as Riddle-Hermione] Who could look at you beside Harry Potter? What are you, compared to the Chosen One...?

Harry Potter:
Ron! It lies! Stab it! STAB IT!

Harry Potter:
[as Riddle-Harry] Your mother confessed that she would have preferred me as a son...

Hermione Granger:
[as Riddle-Hermione] Who wouldn't prefer him? What woman would take you? You are nothing... nothing... nothing to him...

[Riddle-Hermione and Riddle-Harry starts to kiss in the fog. Ron looks shocked. Ron's head turns to Harry, who freezes. A trace of scarlet glints in Ron's eyes]

Ron Weasley:
NOOO!

[Ron raises the sword, stabs it through Riddle-Harry and Riddle-Hermione, and then reaches the locket, and then there's silence]

[deleted scene; the dursleys are departing their home]

Vernon Dursley:
This isn't just goodbye, boy, is it? This is farewell.

Dudley Dursley:
I don't understand. Isn't he coming with us?

Vernon Dursley:
Who?

Dudley Dursley:
Harry.

Vernon Dursley:
Absolutely not.

Dudley Dursley:
Why?

Vernon Dursley:
Why?

[stammering]

Vernon Dursley:
Because he doesn't want to. Do you, boy?

Harry Potter:
Absolutely not, no. Besides, I'm just a waste of space. Isn't that right, Vernon?

Vernon Dursley:
Come on Dudley. We're off.

[Dudley shakes Harry's hand]

Dudley Dursley:
I don't think you're a waste of space.

Harry Potter:
Thanks.

[Dudley goes back to the car with his parents]

Harry Potter:
[Smiles at Dudley] See you, Big D.

[Deleted scene; Harry finds Aunt Petunia standing alone in the empty living room]

Petunia Dursley:
I have lived in this house for twenty years, and now in a single night, I'm expected to leave.

Harry Potter:
They'll torture you. If they think for a moment you know where I'm going, they'll stop at nothing.

Petunia Dursley:
[pause] You think I don't know what they're capable of? You didn't just lose a mother that night in Godric's Hollow, you know. I lost a sister.

Petunia Dursley:
[leaves]

Harry Potter:
Engorgio! [the flame in the jar grows rapidly] Reducio! [the flame shrinks back to normal size]

Hermione Granger:
What's going on in there?

Harry Potter, Ron Weasley:
Nothing!

Harry Potter:
[to James, Lily, Sirus and Remus] I never wanted any of you to die for me.

Ron Weasley:
We can end this.

[from trailer]

Minerva McGonagall:
Hogwarts is threatened! Man the boundaries. Protect us!

Lily Potter:
Harry, you are so loved. Mama loves you. Dada loves you. Harry, be safe. Be strong.

[from trailer]

Harry Potter:
You'll stay with me?

Lily Potter:
Always.

Sirius Black:
Until the end.

[from trailer]

Ron Weasley:
That doesn't sound good.

Molly Weasley:
[to Bellatrix Lestrange] Not my daughter, you b*tch!

[from trailer]

Rubeus Hagrid:
Harry? No.

[from trailer]

Sirius Black:
Until the end.

[from trailer]

Lord Voldemort:
They never learn. Such a pity.

Lord Voldemort:
[to Snape] Only I can live forever.

Professor Severus Snape:
[to Dumbledore about Harry] You've kept him alive so that he can die at the proper moment.

[from trailer]

Lord Voldemort:
[to Lucius] Bring him to me.

Lord Voldemort:
Join me in the forest tonight and confront your fate.

[from trailer]

Lord Voldemort:
Harry Potter, the boy who lived... come to die. Avada Kedavra!

Harry Potter:
There's something hidden here in the castle, and it may help us defeat you-know-who.

Minerva McGonagall:
Do what you have to do. I'll secure the castle.

Hermione Granger:
You're thinking there's a horcrux in Bellatrix's vault?

Bellatrix Lestrange:
[as Hermione] I wish to enter my vault.

Bellatrix Lestrange:
[as Hermione] I don't like to be kept waiting!

Ron Weasley:
[In Bellatrix's Vault] Is it here, Harry? Can you feel anything?

Harry Potter:
[Seeing Helga Huffelpuff's cup] That's it, up there!

Harry Potter:
He knows if we find them, and destroy all the horcruxes we'll be able to kill him. I reckon he'll stop at nothing to make sure we don't find the rest. There's more, one of them is at Hogwarts.

Neville Longbottom:
You were right, never better. I feel like I can spit fire.

Hermione Granger:
[Disguised as Belltrix Lestrange, addressing a Death Eater] Good morning!

Griphook:
Good morning? You're Bellatrix Lestrange, not some dewey-eyed schoolgirl!

Neville Longbottom:
[to the Snatchers] Ya, you and whose army?

Professor Severus Snape:
[to the Hogwart's students] If anyone here knows any knowledge of Mr. Potter's movements this evening, I invite them to step forward... now.

Harry Potter:
[Stepping out of the crowd] It seems despite your exhaustive defensive strategies, you still have a bit of a security problem, Headmaster.

Luna Lovegood:
Harry, wait, I need to talk to you.

Harry Potter:
I'm a bit preoccupied at the moment, Luna.

Luna Lovegood:
You won't find it where you're going, you're wasting your time.

Harry Potter:
We'll talk later, ok?

Luna Lovegood:
Harry!

Harry Potter:
Later!

Luna Lovegood:
Harry Potter! You listen to me right now! Don't you remember what Cho said about Rowena Ravenclaw's diadem? There's not a person alive whose seen it. It's obvious isn't it? You have to talk to someone whose dead.

Draco Malfoy:
[Wand pointed at Harry] Well, well what brings you here Potter?

Harry Potter:
Could ask you the same.

Draco Malfoy:
You have something of mine, I'd like it back.

Harry Potter:
[Nudging to his wand] What's wrong with the one you have?

Draco Malfoy:
It's my mother's, it's powerful but it's... not the same. It doesn't quite... understand me, know what I mean?

Harry Potter:
Why didn't you tell her, Bellatrix, you knew it was me? You didn't say anything.

Gregory Goyle:
C'mon Draco, don't be a prat, do it.

Ron Weasley:
[in Room of Requirement] AHHHHHH! Goyle has set the bloody place on fire!

Ollivander:
[Holding a wand] 12 and three quarter inches... unyielding. This belongs to Bellatrix Lestrange.

Lucius Malfoy:
[Beckoning Draco over] Draco! Draco, don't be stupid!

Narcissa Malfoy:
Draco. Come.

Lord Voldemort:
[Holding out his arms] Welcome, Draco.

Lord Voldemort:
Behold, Nagini, our work is done.

Professor Severus Snape:
For myself and a few select members of staff, this news comes as little surprise. We have for some time now considered Mr. Potter's return to Hogwarts as not merely possible, not inevitable.

Professor Severus Snape:
You have preformed extraordinary magic with this wand, my Lord, in the last hours alone.

Lord Voldemort:
No, I am extraordinary, but the wand... it resists me.

Professor Severus Snape:
There is no wand more powerful, Olivander himself has said. Tonight when the boy comes, it will not fail you I assure you.

Argus Filch:
[about the Slytherin students] Where exactly will I be leading them to, ma'am?

Minerva McGonagall:
The dungeons should do.

Flitwick:
You do realize we can't keep out You-Know-Who indefinitely.

Minerva McGonagall:
That doesn't mean we can't delay him. And his name is Voldemort, so you might as well use it, he's going to try and kill you either way.

Harry Potter:
Dumbledore trusted me to see this through.

Aberforth Dumbledore:
What makes you think you can trust him? What makes you think you can believe anything my brother told you? In all the time you knew him, did he ever mention my name? Did he ever mention hers?

Harry Potter:
Why should he...

Aberforth Dumbledore:
...Keep secrets, you tell me?

Harry Potter:
I trusted him.

Aberforth Dumbledore:
That's a boy's answer. A boy who goes chasing horcruxes on the word of a man who wouldn't even tell you where to start. You're lying!

Professor Severus Snape:
It's come to my attention that earlier this evening Harry Potter was spotted in Hogsmeade. Should anyone attempt to aide Mr. Potter, they will be punished.

Professor Severus Snape:
[to Voldemort] There is no wand more powerful. It answers to you, and to you only.

Ginny Weasley:
[Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville have entered the Room of Requirement] Harry!

Harry Potter:
Hi there.

[pauses waiting for a response from Ginny, then addresses Hermione]

Ron Weasley:
Six months she hadn't see me, it's like I'm a Frankie First Year. I'm only her brother...

Seamus Finnigan:
She's got lots of them, but there's only one Harry.

Ron Weasley:
Shut up Seamus.

Harry Potter:
[to Snape] How dare you stand where he stood! A man who trusted you Tell them how it happened that night. Tell them how you looked him in the eye, and killed him.

Ollivander:
He's after you, Mr. Potter. You really don't stand a chance.

Harry Potter:
I suppose I'll have to kill him before he finds me.

Hermione Granger:
We can't just stand here. Who's got an idea?

Ron Weasley:
Don't ask us. You're the brilliant one!

Harry Potter:
Why are you here, all of you?

Lily Potter:
We never left.

Professor Albus Dumbledore:
You wonderful boy. You brave, brave man.

Professor Albus Dumbledore:
Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living and above all, those who live without love.

Harry Potter:
We have to go there, now.

Hermione Granger:
What? We can't do that! We've got to plan! We've got to figure it out...

Harry Potter:
Hermione! When have any of our plans ever actually worked? We plan, we get there, all hell breaks loose!

Remus Lupin:
It is the quality of ones convictions that determines success, not the number of followers.

Kingsley Shacklebolt:
Who said that?

Remus Lupin:
Me.

Harry Potter:
[Harry's son is nervous to go through the barrier] Together.

Ron Weasley:
[as they're rescuing Draco and Blaise] If we die for them, Harry, I'm going to KILL YOU!

Harry Potter:
[referring to the Thing beneath the bench] What is that, Professor?

Professor Albus Dumbledore:
Something that is beyond either of our help.

Neville Longbottom:
[discussing a battle strategy] Are you really giving us permission to do this?

Minerva McGonagall:
Yes, Longbottom.

Neville Longbottom:
Blow it up? Boom?

Minerva McGonagall:
BOOM!

Minerva McGonagall:
I've always wanted to use that spell.

Gregory Goyle:
[aiming at Hermione] Avada Kedavra!

Ron Weasley:
[chasing them off] Aaarrrgh! That's my girlfriend you numpty!

Bellatrix Lestrange:
[Try to help Voldemort up] My Lord? My Lord?

Lord Voldemort:
[Throwing Bellatrix aside] I do not need your help.

Bellatrix Lestrange:
My Lord!

Minerva McGonagall:
And Potter... it's good to see you.

Harry Potter:
It's good to see you too, Professor.

Lord Voldemort:
How can you live with yourself, Lucius?

Lucius Malfoy:
...I don't know.

Kingsley Shacklebolt:
[watching the protective enchantments start to crack] Actually, Dean, better tell Professor McGonagall we may need two or three more wands on this side.

Harry Potter:
And Remus, your son...

Remus Lupin:
Others will tell him what his mother and father died for. One day, he'll understand.

Lord Voldemort:
[after Neville steps forward] Well I thought we'd do a bit better then that!

Bellatrix Lestrange:
Ha!

Neville Longbottom:
I'd like to say something...

Lord Voldemort:
...I think we'd all be fascinated to hear what you have to say.

Argus Filch:
Students out of bed! Students out of bed! Students out of bed!

Minerva McGonagall:
They are supposed to be out of bed you blithering idiot.

Argus Filch:
...Right, I'm sorry Ma'am.

Minerva McGonagall:
Actually, Mr. Filch, your timing is impeccable. Could you please escort Miss Parkinson, and the rest of Slytherin house out.

Ginny Weasley:
Dad? Who's Hagrid carrying? Dad? Who is it?

Lord Voldemort:
Harry Potter is dead!

Ginny Weasley:
[screaming] No!

Harry Potter:
Does it hurt to die?

Sirius Black:
Quicker then falling asleep.

Harry Potter:
I have to go back, haven't I?

Professor Albus Dumbledore:
Oh, that's up to you.

Harry Potter:
I have a choice?

Professor Albus Dumbledore:
Oh, yes. We're in King's Cross, you say? I think, if you so desired, you'd be able to board a train.

Harry Potter:
And where would it take me?

Professor Albus Dumbledore:
On.

Harry Potter:
Voldemort has the Elder Wand.

Professor Albus Dumbledore:
True.

Harry Potter:
And the snake's still alive.

Professor Albus Dumbledore:
Yes.

Harry Potter:
And I have nothing to kill it with.

Professor Albus Dumbledore:
Words are, in my not-so-humble opinion, our most inexhaustible source of magic. Capable of both inflicting injury, and remedying it.

Harry Potter:
Ginny! Neville! Are you all right?

Neville Longbottom:
Never better! I feel like I could spit fire! You haven't seen Luna have you?

Harry Potter:
Luna?

Neville Longbottom:
I'm mad for her. I think it's about time I told her, since we'll probably both be dead by dawn! [Neville runs up the staircase; Harry and Ginny look at each other for a moment, then kiss]

Ginny Weasley:
[whispering to Harry] I know.

Professor Albus Dumbledore:
We both know Lord Voldemort has ordered the Malfoy boy to murder me. But should he fail, I should presume the Dark Lord will turn to you. You must be the one to kill me, Severus. It is the only way. Only then will the Dark Lord trust you completely.

[Flashback of Snape killing Dumbledore]

Professor Albus Dumbledore:
There will come a time when Harry Potter must be told something. But you must wait until Voldemort is at his most vulnerable.

Professor Severus Snape:
Must be told what?

[Shot of Snape going through the halls of the Potter house]

Professor Albus Dumbledore:
On the night Lord Voldemort went to Godric's Hollow to kill Harry, and Lily Potter cast herself between them, the curse rebounded. When that happened, a part of Voldemort's soul lached itself onto the only living thing it could find. Harry himself. There's a reason Harry can speak with snakes. There's a reason he can look into Lord Voldemort's mind. A part of Voldemort lives inside him.

Professor Severus Snape:
So when the time comes... the boy must die?

Professor Albus Dumbledore:
Yes. Yes... he must die.

[Shot of Snape collapsing at the sight of Lily's dead body]

Professor Severus Snape:
You've kept him alive so that he can die at the proper moment. You've been raising him like a pig for slaughter!

Professor Albus Dumbledore:
Don't tell me now that you've grown to care for the boy.

[Snape casts a Patronus in the shape of a doe, just like Lily's- the same one that helped Harry find the Sword of Gryffindor in Part 1]

Professor Albus Dumbledore:
Lily... after all this time?

[Shot of Snape holding Lily's body in his arms while crying]

Professor Severus Snape:
Always.

Professor Albus Dumbledore:
[after James and Lilly's deaths] The boy survives.

Professor Severus Snape:
He doesn't need protection, the Dark Lord is gone!

Professor Albus Dumbledore:
The Dark Lord will return! And when he does, the boy will be in terrible danger! He has her eyes. [Snape pauses in shock] If you truly loved her...

Professor Severus Snape:
No one... can know.

Professor Albus Dumbledore:
That I shall never reveal the best of you, Severus?

Young Petunia Dursley:
Freak! I'm telling Mummy! You're a freak! You're a freak, Lily!

Young Severus Snape:
She's just jealous. That she's ordinary, and you're special.

Young Lily Potter:
That's mean, Severus.

Professor Severus Snape:
No! Don't kill me!

Professor Albus Dumbledore:
The prophecy did not refer to a women. It spoke of a boy born at the end of July.

Professor Severus Snape:
Yes but, he thinks its her son! He intends to hunt them down now, to kill them. Hide her, hide them all. I beg you.

Professor Albus Dumbledore:
What will you give me in return, Severus?

Professor Severus Snape:
Anything.

Harry Potter:
Is this real? Or has this been happening inside my head?

Professor Albus Dumbledore:
Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?

Professor Severus Snape:
Look at me... you have your mother's eyes.

Minerva McGonagall:
Potter, I assume you're here for a reason. What do you need?

Harry Potter:
Time. As much as you can get me, Professor.

Minerva McGonagall:
Do what you have to. I'll secure the castle.

Bellatrix Lestrange:
The boy... is he dead?

Narcissa Malfoy:
[Leaning into Harry] Is he alive? Draco, is he alive?

Narcissa Malfoy:
[after Harry nods] Dead.

Neville Longbottom:
It doesn't matter that Harry's gone.

Seamus Finnigan:
Stand down Neville!

Neville Longbottom:
People die every day. Friends, family. Yeah, we still lost Harry tonight. He's still with us, in here. [Points to his heart] So's Fred, Remus, Tonks... they didn't die in vain. But YOU will. 'Cause you're wrong! Harry's heart did beat for us! For all of us! It's not over! [He pulls the Sword of Gryffindor from the Sorting Hat]

Harry Potter:
[Harry suddenly drops from Hagrid's arms and aims at Nagini] Confringo!

Bellatrix Lestrange:
[In the sudden confusion, scores of Death Eaters begin to apparate away from Hogwarts] No! No, come back! Lucius! Come back! Come back and fight!

Harry Potter:
I'll lure him into the castle. We have to kill the snake.

Luna Lovegood:
Well, there's Rowena Ravenclaw's lost diadem.

Ron Weasley:
Oh bloody hell, here we go.

Griphook:
How did you come upon that sword?

Harry Potter:
It's complicated. Why did Bellatrix Lestrange think it should be in her vault?

Griphook:
It's complicated.

Lord Voldemort:
From this day forth, you put your faith... in me.

Neville Longbottom:
Right then, so what's the plan Harry?

Harry Potter:
Okay, there's something we need to find, something hidden here in the castle, and it may help us defeat You-Know-Who.

Neville Longbottom:
Right, what is it?

Harry Potter:
We don't know.

Dean Thomas:
Where is it?

Harry Potter:
We don't know that either. I realise that's not much to go on.

Seamus Finnigan:
That's nothing to go on.

Minerva McGonagall:
Why don't you confer with Mr. Finnigan? As I recall, he has a particular proclivity for pyrotechnics.

Seamus Finnigan:
I can bring it down!

Minerva McGonagall:
That's the spirit, now away you go.

George Weasley:
You okay, Freddie?

Fred Weasley:
Yeah.

George Weasley:
Me too.

Professor Albus Dumbledore:
After all this time?

Professor Severus Snape:
Always.

Helena Ravenclaw:
If you have to ask, you'll never know. If you know, you need only ask.

Professor Severus Snape:
[to Harry] You have your mother's eyes.

Neville Longbottom:
It doesn't matter that Harry's gone.

Seamus Finnigan:
Stand down, Neville.

Neville Longbottom:
People die everyday! Friends, family. Yeah, we lost Harry tonight. He's still with us, in here. So's Fred, Remus, Tonks, all of them. They didn't die in vain. But you will! Because you're wrong! Harry's heart did beat for us, for all of us. It's not over!

Harry Potter:
You were right. When you told Professor Snape that wand was failing you. It will always fail you!

Lord Voldemort:
I killed Snape!

Harry Potter:
But what if that wand never belonged to Snape? What if its allegiance was always to someone else? C'mon, Tom... let's finish this the way we started it. Together!

Flitwick:
Protego maxima, Fianto Duri, Repello Inimicum.

Minerva McGonagall:
[to Molly Weasley] I've always wanted to use that spell!

Neville Longbottom:
You and whose army?

Helena Ravenclaw:
I know what he's done! I know who he is! He defiled it! With dark magic!

Lord Voldemort:
Harry Potter is dead!

Ginny Weasley:
No! No!

Lord Voldemort:
[Flicking his wand] Silence! Stupid girl. Harry Potter is dead, from this day forth... you put your faith in me. Harry Potter is dead!

Bellatrix Lestrange:
Ha ha ha!

Lord Voldemort:
Ye-he-he. And now is the time to declare yourself. Come forward and join us... or die.

Lucius Malfoy:
[Extending his hand] Draco... Draco.

Narcissa Malfoy:
Draco, come.

Hermione Granger:
I'll go with you.

Molly Weasley:
Not my daughter, you b*tch!

Lord Voldemort:
[Deleted scene] Why do you live?

Harry Potter:
Because I have something worth living for.

Harry Potter:
Come on Tom, let's finish this the way we started, together.

Argus Filch:
Students out of bed! Students in the corridor!

Minerva McGonagall:
They are supposed to be you blithering idiot!

Argus Filch:
Oh... Sorry Ma'am.

Rubeus Hagrid:
[Harry comes to face death] Harry, no, what'r you doin' here!

Remus Lupin:
[Deleted scene] [Tonks comes running down a corridor, spies Lupin, and throws herself into his arms] You shouldn't have! Teddy needs you.

Nymphadora Tonks:
He'll sleep till dawn and snore like his father. It's you who needs me tonight.

[last lines]

Harry Potter:
Ready?

Albus Severus Potter:
Ready.

[first lines]

Luna Lovegood:
[looking at landscape around Shell Cottage from doorway] It's beautiful here.

Bill Weasley:
It was our aunt's. We used to come here as kids. The order uses it now as a safe house. What's left of us at least.

Luna Lovegood:
[looking at wind chime made of shells] Muggles think these keep away evil, but they're wrong.

Harry Potter:
[to Bill] I need to talk to the goblin.

Harry Potter:
[spoken sternly to Snape] How dare you stand where he stood, a man who trusted you? Tell them how it happened that night, tell them how you looked him in the eyes and killed him!

Albus Severus Potter:
Dad, what if I am put in Slytherin?

Harry Potter:
Albus Severus Potter... you were named for two Headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin, and he was probably the bravest man I've ever known.

Professor Severus Snape:
[Trying to staunch the bleeding wound on Snape's neck, Harry suddenly notices that Snape is crying light, almost crystal tears. Snape gestures towards his eyes] Take them... take them, please.

Harry Potter:
Hermione, give me a flask, anything! [She reaches into her bag and produces a flask, which Harry uses to collect the memory tears running down Snape's cheek. He clutches the bottle in his hand then again tries to staunch Snape's wound]

Professor Severus Snape:
Take them to the Pensieve... and look at me. [Harry stares at him] You have your mother's eyes. [a confused look crosses Harry's face as Snape takes his last breath]

Lord Voldemort:
[as Harry, Ron and Hermione stand in the boathouse, Voldemort's voice echoes throughout the castle grounds] You have fought valiantly, but in vain. [Shot of a female Death Eater disarming George Weasley] I do not wish this. Every drop of magical blood spilled is a terrible waste. I therefore command my forces to retreat. [Shot of all Death Eaters lowering their wands] In their absence, dispose of your dead with dignity. Harry Potter, I now speak directly to you. On this night, you have allowed your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself. [Harry stares at the burning wreckage of Hogwarts] There is no greater dishonor. Join me in the Forbidden Forest and confront your fate. If you do not do this, I shall kill every last man, woman and child who tries to conceal you from me.

Hermione Granger:
[the Trio walks through the courtyard] Where is everybody? [They open the doors to the Great Hall. It is a total wreck, lined with students, teachers, the injured, and the dead. Ron walks in first, followed by Hermione, then Harry, who passes everyone almost as if he is in a daze, unable to comprehend what is going on around him]

Professor Horace Slughorn:
[Applying Dittany to a wound on Filch's arm] Harry...

Professor Pomona Sprout:
[Dealing with a student's wound] Oh come on, what's the matter with you?

Professor Sybil Trelawney:
[Sitting next to Padma Patil and pulling a sheet over a teacher's body] Oh, she's passed.

Padma Patil:
There, she's gone.

Ron Weasley:
[the next sight stops Harry dead in his tracks. The Weasley family are gathered around the body of Fred. Ginny and Percy both stand motionless. Bill holds a crying Fleur. Molly's head is buried on her dead son's shoulder. Arthur is trying to comfort George as best he can. George sees Ron and grabs onto him for dear life, sobbing uncontrollably. Ron kneels over Fred's body and lays his head down on his chest as Molly gently strokes both of their heads] No! No! NO! [Stunned, Harry glances to his left and sees the body of Remus and Tonks]

Harry Potter:
[Walking into a clearing in the Forest, Harry pulls the Snitch from his pocket] I'm ready to die. [He kisses it, and it opens to reveal a small black stone] The Resurrection Stone... [he holds it in his hands, and closes his eyes. As he opens them, his parents, Sirius, and Remus appear in the clearing]

Lily Potter:
[Lily smiles at her son and holds her hand out to him. Harry reaches out to touch it, but finds his own hand just passes through hers] You've been so brave, sweetheart.

Harry Potter:
Why are you here? All of you?

Lily Potter:
We never left.

Harry Potter:
[He turns to Sirius] Does it-does it hurt? Dying?

Sirius Black:
Quicker than falling asleep.

James Potter:
You're nearly there, son.

Harry Potter:
I'm sorry. I never wanted any of you to die for me. [He turns to Lupin] And Remus, your son...

Remus Lupin:
Others will tell him what his mother and father died for. One day, he'll understand.

Harry Potter:
You'll stay with me?

James Potter:
Until the end.

Harry Potter:
And he won't be able to see you?

Sirius Black:
No. [He reaches towards Harry's heart] We're here, you see.

Harry Potter:
Stay close to me.

Lily Potter:
Always. [He drops the Stone, and is once again alone]

Hermione Granger:
[Walking out of Dumbledore's office, now knowing what he must do, Harry sees Ron and Hermione holding each other on the Grand Staircase. Upon hearing his footsteps, Hermione stands up to face him] Where have you been?

Ron Weasley:
We thought you went to the Forest.

Harry Potter:
I'm going there now.

Ron Weasley:
Are you mad? No. You can't give yourself up to him.

Hermione Granger:
What is it, Harry? What is it you know?

Harry Potter:
There's a reason I can hear them... the Horcruxes. I think I've known for awhile. [Realization dawns on Hermione] And I think you have too.

Hermione Granger:
[She begins to cry] I'll go with you!

Harry Potter:
No. Kill the snake. Kill the snake and then it's just him. [Hermione runs to hug him. Harry glances over her shoulder and looks at Ron, knowing it may be the last time he ever sees either of his best friends]

[Voldemort and his entire army are assembled outside Hogwarts]

Lord Voldemort:
...Begin.

[the Death Eaters unleash a hail of spells that batter against the protective shield]

If you have to ask, you'll never know. If you know, you need only ask.

It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.

“I’ve always wanted to use that spell!”

-Professor McGonagall

Dumbledore:
After all this time?

Snape:
Always.

George:
You ready Freddy?

Fred:
Ya

George:
Me to

Hey guys, I have got the time-rift! This isn't over!

Ollivander:
He's after you, Mr. Potter. If it's true what you say and he (Voldemort) has found the Elder Wand, I'm afraid you really don't stand a chance.

Harry Potter:
I suppose I'll have to kill him before he finds me, then.

Hermione Granger:
[disguised as Bellatrix Lestrange, addressing a Death Eater] Good morning!

Ron Weasley:
Good morning? Good morning? You're Bellatrix Lestrange, not some dewey-eyed schoolgirl!

Griphook:
Oi! Watch it!

Hermione:
No, he's right. I was being stupid.

Harry Potter:
He knows. You-Know-Who. He knows we broke into Gringotts, he knows what we took, and he knows we're hunting Horcruxes.

Hermione Granger:
How is it you know?

Harry Potter:
I saw him.

Hermione Granger:
You let him in? Harry, you can't do that!

Harry Potter:
Hermione, I can't always help it! Well, maybe I can, I don't know.

Ron Weasley:
Never mind; what happened?

Harry Potter:
Well, he's angry, and he's scared too. He knows if we find and destroy all the Horcruxes, we'll be able to kill him. I reckon he'll stop at nothing to make sure we don't find the rest. There's more. One of them's at Hogwarts.

Hermione Granger:
What? You saw it?

Harry Potter:
I saw the castle. And Rowena Ravenclaw. They must have something to do with her. We have to go there, now.

Hermione Granger:
What? We can't do that! We've got to plan, we've got to figure it out...

Harry Potter:
Hermione, when have any of our plans ever actually worked? We plan, we get there, all hell breaks loose.

Ron Weasley:
He's right. One problem. Snape's headmaster now; we can't just walk in through the front door.

Harry Potter:
Well, we'll go to Hogsmeade, to Honeyduke's. Take the secret passage in the cellar. It's... There's something wrong with him. It's like, you know, in the past, I've always been able to follow his thoughts. And now, everything just feels disconnected.

Ron Weasley:
Maybe it's the Horcruxes. Maybe he's growing weaker; maybe he's dying.

Harry Potter:
No. No, it's...it's more like he's wounded. If anything, he feels more dangerous.

Aberforth Dumbledore:
Bloody fools, what were you thinking coming here? Have you any idea of how dangerous it is?

Harry Potter:
Aberforth, Dumbledore's brother. It's you that I've been seeing in here. You're the one who sent Dobby.

Aberforth Dumbledore:
Where have you left him?

Harry Potter:
He's dead.

Aberforth Dumbledore:
Sorry to hear it. I liked that elf.

Harry Potter:
Who gave that to you? The mirror?

Aberforth Dumbledore:
Mundungus Fletcher. About a year ago.

Harry Potter:
Dung had no right sending it to you. It belongs to...

Aberforth Dumbledore:
Sirius. Albus told me. He also told me you'd likely be hacked off if you ever found out that I had it, but ask yourself: where would you be if I didn't? [Gives the trio some food]

Hermione Granger:
Do you hear from the others much? From the Order?

Aberforth Dumbledore:
The Order's finished. You-Know-Who's won. Anyone who says otherwise is killing themselves.

Harry Potter:
We need to get into Hogwarts, tonight. Dumbledore gave us a job to do.

Aberforth Dumbledore:
Did he now? Nice job? Easy?

Harry Potter:
We've been hunting Horcruxes. We think the last one's inside the castle, but we'll need your help in getting in.

Aberforth Dumbledore:
It's not a job my brother's given you. It's a suicide mission. Do yourself a favor, boy, and go home. Live a little longer.

Harry Potter:
Dumbledore trusted me to see this through.

Aberforth Dumbledore:
What makes you think you can trust him? What makes you think you can believe anything my brother told you? In all the time you knew him, did he ever mention my name? Did he ever mention hers?

Harry Potter:
Why should he...

Aberforth Dumbledore:
...Keep secrets, you tell me?

Harry Potter:
I trusted him.

Aberforth Dumbledore:
That's a boy's answer. A boy who goes chasing Horcruxes on the word of a man who wouldn't even tell you where to start. You're lying! Not just to me, it doesn't matter, but to yourself as well. That's what a fool does. You don't strike me as a fool, Harry Potter. So, I'll ask you again, there must be a reason.

[after a moment of silence]

Harry Potter:
I'm not interested in what happened between you and your brother. I don't care that you've given up. I trusted the man I knew. We need to get into the castle tonight.

Ginny Weasley:
[sees Harry] Harry!

Harry Potter:
Hi there.

Ron Weasley:
Six months she hasn't see me, it's like I'm a Frankie First Year. I'm only her brother...

Seamus Finnigan:
She's got lots of them, but only one Harry.

Ron Weasley:
Shut up, Seamus. [to Ginny] What is it, Ginny?

Ginny Weasley:
Snape knows. He knows that Harry was spotted in Hogsmeade.

[All of the students stare at the trio disapprovingly]

Neville Longbottom:
Right then, so what's the plan, Harry?

Harry Potter:
Okay, there's something we need to find, something hidden here in the castle, and it may help us defeat You-Know-Who.

Neville Longbottom:
Right, what is it?

Harry Potter:
We don't know.

Dean Thomas:
Where is it?

Harry Potter:
We don't know that either. I realize that's not much to go on.

Seamus Finnigan:
That's nothing to go on.

Professor Snape:
[to the Hogwart's students] Many of you are surely wondering why I have summoned you at this hour. It's come to my attention that earlier this evening, Harry Potter was sighted in Hogsmeade. Now, should anyone, student or staff, attempt to aid Mr. Potter, they will be punished, in a manner consistent with the severity of their transgression. Furthermore, any person found to have knowledge of these events... who fails to come forward, will be treated... as... equally guilty. If anyone here knows any knowledge of Mr. Potter's movements this evening, I invite them to step forward... now.

[There is a long pause, as the assembled students just stare at the ground in terror. Harry then steps out from the crowd, causing audible gasps from everyone present]

Harry Potter:
[coldly] It seems despite your exhaustive defensive strategies, you still have a bit of a security problem, Headmaster. [Order of Phoenix members enter] And I'm afraid it's quite extensive. How dare you stand where he (Dumbledore) stood. Tell them how it happened that night! How you looked him in the eye, a man who trusted you, and killed him! Tell them!

Pansy Parkinson:
[after a long silence] What are you waiting for? Someone grab him!

[Ginny, Hermione and the other walk up to protect Harry.]

Argus Filch:
[running in with Mrs Norris yelling] Students out of bed! STUDENTS OUT OF BED! Students in the corridor!

Minerva McGonagall:
[snapping] They're supposed to be out of bed, you blithering idiot!

Argus Filch:
Oh. Sorry, ma'am.

Minerva McGonagall:
As it happens, Mr Filch, your arrival is most opportune. If you would, I would like you, please, to lead Miss Parkinson and the rest of Slytherin House from the Hall!

Argus Filch:
Exactly where is it I'll be leading them to, ma'am?

Minerva McGonagall:
The dungeons will do.

Neville Longbottom:
Let me get this straight, Professor. [grabs her arm] You're actually giving us permission to do this?

Minerva McGonagall:
That is correct, Longbottom.

Neville Longbottom:
To blow it up? Boom?

Minerva McGonagall:
BOOM!

Neville Longbottom:
[laughing] Wicked. But how on earth are we gonna do that?

Minerva McGonagall:
Why don't you confer with Mr. Finnigan? As I recall, he has a particular proclivity for pyrotechnics.

Seamus Finnigan:
[nodding] I can bring her down.

Minerva McGonagall:
That's the spirit. Off you go.

Filius Flitwick:
You do realize, of course, we can't keep out You-Know-Who indefinitely.

Minerva McGonagall:
That doesn't mean we can't delay him. And his name is Voldemort. Filius, you might as well use it. He's going to try to kill you either way.

Remus Lupin:
It is the quality of ones convictions that determines success, not the number of followers.

Kingsley Shacklebolt:
Who said that?

Remus Lupin:
Me.

Luna Lovegood:
Harry, wait, I need to talk to you.

Harry Potter:
I'm a bit preoccupied at the moment, Luna.

Luna Lovegood:
You won't find it where you're going, you're wasting your time.

Harry Potter:
We'll talk later, okay, Luna?

Luna Lovegood:
Harry!

Harry Potter:
Later!

Luna Lovegood:
[shouting] Harry Potter! You listen to me right now! [calmer] Don't you remember what Cho said about Rowena Ravenclaw's diadem? There's not a person alive who's seen it. It's obvious, isn't it? You have to talk to someone who's dead.

Harry Potter:
You're the Grey Lady. The Ghost of Ravenclaw Tower.

Helena Ravenclaw:
I do not answer to that name.

Harry Potter:
No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's Helena, isn't it? Helena Ravenclaw. Rowena's daughter.

Helena Ravenclaw:
Are you a friend of Luna's?

Harry Potter:
Yes. And she thought you might be able to help me.

Helena Ravenclaw:
You seek my mother's diadem.

Harry Potter:
Yes. That's right.

Helena Ravenclaw:
Luna is kind, unlike so many of the others. But she was wrong. I cannot help you.

Harry Potter:
Wait! Please! I want to destroy it. [pause] That's what you want too, isn't it, Helena? You want it destroyed.

Helena Ravenclaw:
Another swore to destroy it many years ago... a strange boy with a strange name.

Harry Potter:
Tom Riddle.

Helena Ravenclaw:
But he lied.

Harry Potter:
He's lied to many people.

Helena Ravenclaw:
I know what he's done! I know who he is! HE DEFILED IT WITH DARK MAGIC!

[after a moment of silence]

Harry Potter:
I can destroy it once and for all. But only if you tell me where he hid it. You do know where he hid it, don't you, Helena? You just have to tell me. Please.

Helena Ravenclaw:
Strange. You remind me of him a bit. It's here, in the castle, in the place where everything is hidden. If you have to ask, you will never know. If you know, you need only ask.

Harry Potter:
Thank you.

Draco Malfoy:
[points his wand at Harry] Well, well. What brings you here, Potter?

Harry Potter:
Might ask you the same.

Draco Malfoy:
You have something of mine. I'd like it back.

Harry Potter:
[Nudging to his wand] Well, what's wrong with the one you have?

Draco Malfoy:
It's my mother's, it's powerful but it's... not the same. It doesn't quite... understand. You know what I mean?

Harry Potter:
Why didn't you tell her? Bellatrix? You knew it was me. But you didn't say anything.

Gregory Goyle:
C'mon Draco, don't be a prat, do it.

[Hermione enters, firing a spell at them]

Lucius Malfoy:
My Lord, might it be less... Might it not be more prudent to call off this attack? Simply seek the boy yourself?

Lord Voldemort:
I do not need to seek the boy. Before the night is out, he will come to me! Do you understand?! [slaps his face] Look at me! How can you live with yourself, Lucius?

Lucius Malfoy:
I... I don't know.

Lord Voldemort:
Go and find Severus. Bring him to me.

Severus Snape:
You have performed extraordinary magic with this wand, my Lord, in the last few hours alone.

Lord Voldemort:
No. No, I am extraordinary, but the wand... resists me.

Severus Snape:
There is no wand more powerful, Ollivander himself has said. Tonight, when the boy comes, it will not fail you, I am sure of it. It answers to you, and you only.

Lord Voldemort:
Does it?

Severus Snape:
My Lord...

Lord Voldemort:
The wand, does it truly answer to me? You're a clever man, Severus. Surely, you must know. Where does its true loyalty lie?

Severus Snape:
With you, of course, my Lord.

Lord Voldemort:
The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly because I am not its true master. The Elder Wand belongs to the wizard who killed its last owner. You killed Dumbledore, Severus. While you live, the Elder Wand cannot truly be mine. You've been a good and faithful servant, Severus, but only I can live..forever.

Severus Snape:
My Lord... [Voldemort slashes with his wand and cuts Snape's throat; blood spills; Severus falls onto the window]

Lord Voldemort:
Nagini, kill. [Nagini repeatedly bites Snape, mortally wounding him]

[Harry is seeing Snape's memories]

Severus Snape:
It will contain the curse to your hand for the time being. It will spread, Albus.

Albus Dumbledore:
How long?

Severus Snape:
Maybe a year.

[Snape turns to leave, but Dumbledore stops him]

Albus Dumbledore:
Don't ignore me, Severus. We both know Lord Voldemort has ordered the Malfoy boy to murder me. But should he fail, one should presume that the Dark Lord would turn to you. You must be the one to kill me, Severus. It is the only way. Only then will the Dark Lord trust you completely. [We see Dumbledore being killed by Snape, as shown in Half-Blood Prince] There will come a time when Harry Potter must be told something, but you must wait until Lord Voldemort is at his most vulnerable.

Severus Snape:
Must be told what?

[As Dumbledore speaks, we see a worried Snape running inside the Potter home]

Albus Dumbledore:
On the night Lord Voldemort went to Godric's Hollow to kill Harry, and Lily Potter cast herself between them, the curse rebounded. When that happened, a part of Voldemort's soul latched itself onto the only living thing that it could find: Harry himself. There is a reason Harry can speak with snakes. There is a reason he could look into Voldemort's mind. A part of Voldemort lives inside him.

Severus Snape:
So, when the time comes...the boy must die?

Albus Dumbledore:
Yes, yes, he must die.

[We see Snape arrive in Harry's bedroom and collapsing in horror at the sight of Lily's dead body]

Severus Snape:
You've kept him so he can die at the proper moment. You've been raising him like a pig for slaughter!

Albus Dumbledore:
Don't tell me now that you've grown to care for the boy. [Snape casts a deer Patronus, the same one that helped Harry find the Sword of Gryffindor in Part 1] Lily? [A crying Snape is shown holding Lily's body] After all this time?

Severus Snape:
Always. So, when the time comes...the boy must die?

Albus Dumbledore:
Yes, he must die. And Voldemort himself must do it. That is essential.

Harry Potter:
[Walking into a clearing in the Forest, Harry pulls the Snitch from his pocket] I'm ready to die. [He kisses it, and it opens to reveal a small black stone] The Resurrection Stone...

[his parents, Sirius, and Remus appear in the clearing]

Lily Potter:
You've been so brave, sweetheart.

Harry Potter:
Why are you here, all of you?

Lily Potter:
We never left.

Harry Potter:
Does it hurt, dying?

Sirius Black:
Quicker than falling asleep.

James Potter:
You're nearly there, son.

Harry Potter:
I'm sorry. I never wanted any of you to die for me. And Remus, your son...

Remus Lupin:
Others will tell him what his mother and father died for. One day, he'll understand.

Harry Potter:
You'll stay with me?

James Potter:
Until the end.

Harry Potter:
And he won't be able to see you?

Sirius Black:
No. [points to Harry's heart] We're here, you see.

Harry Potter:
Stay close to me.

Lily Potter:
Always.

Albus Dumbledore:
Harry, you wonderful boy. You brave man. Let us walk.

Harry Potter:
Professor, what is that?

Albus Dumbledore:
Something beyond either of our help. A part of Voldemort, sent here to die.

Harry Potter:
And exactly where are we?

Albus Dumbledore:
I was going to ask you that. Where would you say that we are?

Harry Potter:
Well, it looks like King's Cross Station, only cleaner, and without all the trains.

Albus Dumbledore:
King's Cross, is that right? This is, as they say, your party. I expect you now realize that you and Voldemort have been connected by something other than fate, since that night in Godric's Hollow all those years ago.

Harry Potter:
So it's true then, isn't it, Sir? A part of him lives in me, doesn't it?

Albus Dumbledore:
Did. It was just destroyed many moments ago by none other than Voldemort himself. You were the Horcux he never meant to make, Harry.

[They sit on a bench]

Harry Potter:
I have to go back, haven't I?

Albus Dumbledore:
Oh, that's up to you.

Harry Potter:
I have a choice?

Albus Dumbledore:
Oh, yes. We're in King's Cross, you say? I think if you so desired, you'd be able to board a train.

Harry Potter:
And where would it take me?

Albus Dumbledore:
[chuckles] On.

[Dumbledore begins walking away]

Harry Potter:
Voldemort has the Elder Wand.

Albus Dumbledore:
True.

Harry Potter:
And the snake's still alive.

Albus Dumbledore:
Yes.

Harry Potter:
And I've nothing to kill it with.

Albus Dumbledore:
[walks back to Harry] Help will always be given at Hogwarts, Harry, to those who ask for it. I've always prized myself on my ability to turn a phrase. Words are, in my not so humble opinion, our most inexhaustible source of magic. Capable of both inflicting injury, and remedying it. But I would, in this case, amend my original statement to this: Help would always be given at Hogwarts to those who deserve it. Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living. And above all, those who live without love.

Harry Potter:
Professor, my mother's Patronus was a doe, wasn't it? It's the same as Professor Snape's. It's curious, don't you think?

Albus Dumbledore:
Actually, if I think about it, it doesn't seem curious at all. I'll be going now, Harry. [turns to leave]

Harry Potter:
Professor? Is this all real? Or is it just happening inside my head?

Albus Dumbledore:
Of course it's happening inside your head, Harry. Why should that mean that it's not real? [he fades into the light]

Harry Potter:
Professor, what shall I do? Professor?

Ginny Weasley:
Who is that Hagrid's carrying? Neville, who is it?

Lord Voldemort:
Harry Potter... is dead!

Ginny Weasley:
No! NO!!

Lord Voldemort:
Silence! [fires a spell towards Ginny, causing her to back down] Stupid girl. Harry Potter is dead. [to Hogwarts' assembled] From this day forth, you put your faith... in me. [to Death Eaters] Harry Potter is dead! [He and his Death Eaters laugh] And now is the time to declare yourself. Come forward and join us... or die.

Lucius Malfoy:
Draco! Draco.

Narcissa Malfoy:
Draco, come.

[Reluctantly, Draco walks over to Voldemort, who hugs him]

Lord Voldemort:
Well done, Draco. Well done. [Draco walks to his parents. Neville comes forward] Well, I must say, I hoped for better. [Death Eaters laugh] And who might you be, young man?

Neville Longbottom:
Neville Longbottom. [Death Eaters laugh]

Bellatrix Lestrange:
Ha-ha!

Lord Voldemort:
Well, Neville, I'm sure we can find a place for you in our ranks--

Neville Longbottom:
I'd like to say something.

Lord Voldemort:
[makes a fist, but then lowers it] Well, Neville, I'm sure we'd all be fascinated to hear what you have to say.

Neville Longbottom:
It doesn't matter that Harry's gone.

Seamus Finnigan:
Stand down, Neville.

Neville Longbottom:
People die every day. Friends, family. Yeah, we lost Harry tonight. But he's still with us, in here. [gestures to his heart] So's Fred, and Remus, Tonks... all of them. They didn't die in vain. [to Voldemort] But you will, 'cause you're wrong! Harry's heart did beat for us, for all of us! It's not over!

[He draws the Sword of Gryffindor. Harry's eyes open, he flings out of Hagrid's arms, and pulls out his wand, to Voldemort's utter and complete shock]

Harry Potter:
Confringo!

[He fires a spell at Voldemort's snake, Nagini, but it reflects onto the Death Eaters. As Harry begins to run, Voldemort, now enraged, fires several curses at Harry. As he does, some of his Death Eaters begin to disapparate]

Bellatrix Lestrange:
No! No, come back! Lucius! Come back! Come back and fight!

[Some Death Eaters continue to leave, but many stay behind to join Voldemort, who is about to charge the castle]

Harry Potter:
[to Ron, Hermione, and Neville] I'll lure him into the castle! We have to kill the snake.

[During Harry and Voldemort's final duel]

Harry Potter:
You were right. When you told Professor Snape that wand was failing you, It will always fail you.

Lord Voldemort:
I killed Snape!

Harry Potter:
But what if the Wand never belonged to Snape? What if its allegiance was always to someone else? Come on, Tom. Let's finish this the way we started it: TOGETHER! [Throws himself and Voldemort off the roof]

[Harry, Ron and Hermione are walking on the damaged Viaduct after Voldemort's death]

Hermione Granger:
Why didn't it work for him? The Elder Wand?

Harry Potter:
It answered to somebody else. When he killed Snape, he thought the Wand would become his, but the thing is, the Wand never belonged to Snape. It was Draco who disarmed Dumbledore that night at the Astronomy Tower. From that moment on, the Wand answered to him, until... the other night, when I disarmed Draco at Malfoy Manor.

Ron Weasley:
So that means...

Harry Potter:
...It's mine.

Ron Weasley:
What do you reckon we should do with it?

Hermione Granger:
We?

Ron Weasley:
I'm just saying, that's the Elder Wand, the most powerful wand in the world. With that, we'd be invincible.

[Harry, after thinking for a moment, breaks the Wand in two, and throws it away]

[Last lines of the final film]

Albus Severus Potter:
Dad, what if I am put in Slytherin?

Harry Potter:
Albus Severus Potter, you were named after two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin, and he was the bravest man I've ever known.

Albus Severus Potter:
But just say that I am.

Harry Potter:
Then Slytherin House will have gained a wonderful, young wizard. But, listen, if it really means that much to you, you can choose Gryffindor. The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account.

Albus Severus Potter:
Really?

Harry Potter:
Really. [Train whistle blows] Ready?

Albus Severus Potter:
Ready.

[McGonagall and Snape fight with their wands as all the students move to either side of the Great Hall. The Carrows fall to the ground as a result of Snape’s redirection of McGonagall’s spell and Snape then retreats]

Minerva McGonagall:
Coward!

Pansy Parkinson:
[after a long silence] What are you waiting for? Someone grab him!

[Ginny, Hermione and the others walk up to protect Harry.]

Argus Filch:
[running in with Mrs. Norris; yelling] Students out of bed! STUDENTS OUT OF BED! Students in the corridor!

Minerva McGonagall:
[snapping] They're supposed to be out of bed, you blithering idiot!

Argus Filch:
Oh. Sorry, ma'am.

Minerva McGonagall:
As it happens, Mr. Filch, your arrival is most opportune. If you would, I would like you, please, to lead Miss Parkinson and the rest of Slytherin House from the Hall! [motions with her wand]

Argus Filch:
Exactly where is it I'll be leading ‘em to, ma'am?

Minerva McGonagall:
The dungeons would do.

[The other students cheer wildly]

Minerva McGonagall:
I presume you have a reason for returning, Potter. What is it you need?

Harry Potter:
Time, Professor. As much as you can get me.

Minerva McGonagall:
Do what you have to do. I’ll secure the castle. [as Harry turns to leave] And Potter, it’s good to see you.

Harry Potter:
It’s good to see you, too, Professor. [leaves]

Harry Potter:
[to Neville]: Hold the fort, Neville.

George Weasley:
You okay, Freddie?

Fred Weasley:
Yeah.

George Weasley:
Me too.

Ron Weasley:
[About Griphook] That little git. Least we've still got Bogrod. [Bogrod gets incinerated by the dragon] That's unfortunate.

Ron Weasley:
[After Goyle attempted to kill Hermione with the Killing Curse in the Room of Requirement] That's my girlfriend, you numpties!

Ron Weasley:
Goyle's set the bloody place on fire!

Ron Weasley:
[about saving Malfoy] If we die for them, Harry, I'm gonna KILL YOU!

Lord Voldemort:
[to Nagini, speaking in Parseltongue] The boy has discovered our secret, Nagini. It makes us vulnerable. We must deploy all our forces now to find him. And you, my friend, must stay close.

Lord Voldemort:
[watching as Hogwarts is protected by spells] They never learn. Pity.

Lord Voldemort:
[to all of Hogwarts] I know that many of you will want to fight. Some of you may even think that to fight is wise. But this is folly. Give me Harry Potter. Do this and none shall be harmed. Give me Harry Potter, and I shall leave Hogwarts untouched. Give me Harry Potter, and you will be rewarded. You have one hour.

Lord Voldemort:
[to all of Hogwarts] You have fought valiantly, but in vain. I do not wish this. Every drop of magical blood spilled is a terrible waste. I therefore command my forces to retreat. In their absence, dispose of your dead with dignity. Harry Potter, I now speak directly to you. On this night, you have allowed your friends to die for you, rather than face me yourself. There is no greater dishonor. Join me in the Forbidden Forest, and confront your fate. If you do not do this, I shall kill every last man, woman and child who tries to conceal you from me.

Lord Voldemort:
Harry Potter, the Boy who Lived... come to die. [pause] Avada Kedavra!

Lord Voldemort:
[last words] I killed Snape.

Severus Snape:
[last words, as Harry collects his tears] Take them to the Pensieve. Look at me. You have your mother's eyes. [dies]

Minerva Mcgonagall:
[to the statues after bringing them to life and fight by using the spell Piertotum Locomotor] Hogwarts is threatened! Man the boundaries, protect us! Do your duty to our school! [to Molly, excited] I've always wanted to use that spell!

Lily Potter:
[in Snape’s memory] Harry, you are so loved, so loved. [Whispering] Harry, Mama loves you. Dada loves you. Harry, be safe. Be strong.

Molly Weasley:
[in anger towards Bellatrix for trying to kill Ginny] Not my daughter, YOU B*TCH!

Ginny Weasley:
[while Harry zips her dress up] Seems silly, doesn't it? A wedding. Given everything that's going on.

Harry Potter:
Maybe that's the best reason to have it. Because of everything that's going on.

[She turns to him and they kiss. George sneaks into the kitchen silently; he stirs a cup of tea and sticks the spoon in the hole where his ear was.]

George Weasley:
[after Ginny spots him and stopped kissing Harry] Morning.

Hermione Granger:
[upon arriving at Godric's Hollow] We should have taken Polyjuice.

Harry Potter:
No... this is where I was born. I won't return as someone else.

Harry Potter:
This is mental.

Hermione Granger:
Completely.

Ron Weasley:
The world's mental.

Alastor 'Mad-Eye' Moody:
Potter, you're underage, which means you still have the Trace on you.

Harry Potter:
What's the Trace?

Alastor 'Mad-Eye' Moody:
If you sneeze, the Ministry will know who wipes your nose. Point is, we'll have to use those means of transport the Trace can't detect: Brooms, Thestrals, and the like; we'll go in pairs. That way if anyone's out there waiting for us, and I reckon there will be... they won't know which Harry Potter is the real one.

Harry Potter:
The real one?

Alastor 'Mad-Eye' Moody:
[brings out Polyjuice Potion] I reckon that you're familiar with this particular brew.

Harry Potter:
[recognizes it] No, absolutely not.

Hermione Granger:
Told you he'd take it well.

Alastor 'Mad-Eye' Moody:
For those of you who haven't taken Polyjuice Potion before, fair warning: It tastes like goblin piss.

Fred Weasley:
Have lots of experience with that, do you, Mad-Eye? ...Just trying to diffuse the tension.

Kingsley Shacklebolt:
[pointing his wand at Lupin] The last words that Albus Dumbledore said to the pair of us?

Remus Lupin:
Harry is the best hope we have. Trust him.

Lord Voldemort:
Severus. I was beginning to worry that you had lost your way. Come, we've saved you a seat. You bring news, I trust?

Severus Snape:
It will happen Saturday next, at nightfall.

Corban Yaxley:
I heard differently, my Lord. Dawlish, the Auror, has let slip that the Potter boy will not be moved until the 30th of this month, the day before he turns 17.

Severus Snape:
This is a false trail. The Auror office no longer plays any part in the protection of Harry Potter.

Fred Weasley:
[walking into burrow and seeing the injured George] How you feeling, Georgie?

George Weasley:
[quietly] Saint-like.

Fred Weasley:
[confused pause] Come again?

George Weasley:
Saint like. I'm holy... [Points to spot where his ear is missing] Holey, get it?

Fred Weasley:
[laughs quietly] The whole world of ear-related humor, and you go for, I'm holy? You're pathetic.

George Weasley:
Reckon I'm still better looking than you.

Lord Voldemort:
What say you, Pius?

Pius Thicknesse:
One hears many things my Lord, and if the truth is among them is not clear.

Lord Voldemort:
Ha! Spoken like a true politician. You will, I think, prove most useful, Pius.

[Harry, Ron, and Hermione are in their tent, and Harry and Hermione are discussing a theory on how they could destroy the rest of the Horcruxes with the sword of Godric Gryffindor.]

Harry Potter:
There's just one problem.

Ron Weasley:
The sword was stolen. [Walks up, turns the lamp back on with his Deluminator. Ron has a stony look on his face.] Yeah. I'm still here. But you two carry on. Don't let me spoil your fun.

Harry Potter:
What's wrong?

Ron Weasley:
Well, nothing's wrong. Not according to you, anyway.

Harry Potter:
Look, if you've got something to say, don't be shy. Spit it out.

Ron Weasley:
All right, I'll spit it out. But don't expect me to be grateful just because now there's another damn thing we've gotta find.

Harry Potter:
I thought you knew what you signed up for!

Ron Weasley:
Yeah. I thought I did, too.

Harry Potter:
Well then, I'm sorry, but I don't quite understand. What part of this isn't living up to your expectations? Did you think we were gonna be staying in a five-star hotel? Finding a Horcrux every other day? You thought you'd be back with your mum by Christmas?

Ron Weasley:
I just thought after all this time we would have actually achieved something! I thought you knew what you were doing! I thought Dumbledore would've told you something worthwhile! I thought you had a plan!

Harry Potter:
I told you everything Dumbledore told me! And in case you haven't noticed, we have found a Horcrux already.

Ron Weasley:
[bitterly] Yeah and we're about as close to getting rid of it as we are to finding the rest of them, aren't we?

Hermione Granger:
[trying to intervene] Ron, please. [She tries to take the locket off of Ron, but he angrily shoves her away] Please take the Horcrux off! You won't be saying any of this if you hadn't been wearing it all day!

Ron Weasley:
You don't know why I listen to that radio every night, do ya? To make sure I don't hear Ginny's name. Or Fred, or George, or Mum--

Harry Potter:
What, you think I'm not listening too? YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS FEELS?!

Ron Weasley:
NO, YOU DON'T KNOW HOW IT FEELS! Your parents are dead! You have no family!

[Furious at what Ron just said, Harry attacks him]

Hermione Granger:
Stop! Stop! [pulls the boys apart]

Harry Potter:
FINE THEN, GO!!! GO THEN!

[Ron wrenches the locket off and gets his bag]

Hermione Granger:
Ron...

Ron Weasley:
[turns to Hermione] And you? Are you coming or are you staying? [Hermione looks torn; she glances from Harry to Ron in shock] Fine. I get it. I saw you two the other night.

Hermione Granger:
[tears in her eyes] Ron, that's – that's nothing!

Ron Weasley:
How long do you think she'll stay mad at me?

Harry Potter:
Just keep talking about that little ball of light touching your heart, and she'll come 'round.

Fred and George:
[disguised as Harry] Wow, we're identical!

Moody:
Not yet, you're not.

Harry Potter:
[about Ron, after he returns] You're not still mad at him, are you?

Hermione Granger:
I'm always mad at him.

Dobby the House Elf:
[in the kitchen at Grimmauld Place] And then Dobby saw Kreacher talking to the thief Mundungus...

Mundungus Fletcher:
[interrupting] I'm not a thief! You foul little... git! I'm a buyer and purveyor of valuable and wondrous objects.

Ron Weasley:
You're a thief, Dung, everyone knows it!

Remus Lupin:
What creature sat in the corner the first time Harry Potter visited my office in Hogwarts?

Harry Potter:
ARE YOU MAD?

Remus Lupin:
WHAT CREATURE!?

Harry Potter:
A Grindylow!

Remus Lupin:
[releases Harry] We've been betrayed. Voldemort knew you were coming tonight. I had to make sure you're not an impostor.

Kingsley Shacklebolt:
What gave you away?

Harry Potter:
Hedwig, I think. She was trying to protect me.

Ron Weasley:
[as Cattermole] Morning.

Harry Potter:
[as Runcorn] Ron, it's me.

Ron Weasley:
[as Cattermole] Harry! Blimey, forgot what you look like. Where's Hermione?

Harry Potter:
[as Runcorn] She's gone down to the courtrooms, with Umbridge.

Ron Weasley:
[as Cattermole] Oh, my God. What am I gonna do? My wife's all alone downstairs.

Harry Potter:
[as Runcorn] Ron, you don't have a wife.

Ron Weasley:
[as Cattermole] Oh, right.

Yaxley:
Cattermole. It's still raining inside my office. That's two days now.

Ron Weasley:
[as Cattermole] Have you tried an umbrella?

[Umbridge is presiding over Mrs. Cattermole's Hearing, while Harry (disguised as Albert Runcorn), witnesses, Ron (disguised as her husband, Reg), takes his place beside her, and Hermione (disguised as Mafalda Hopkirk) records the minutes]

Umbridge:
Mary Elizabeth Cattermole?

Mrs. Cattermole:
Yes?

Umbridge:
A wand was taken from you upon your arrival at the Ministry today, Mrs. Cattermole. [holds up said wand] Is this that wand? [She nods] Would you please tell the court from which witch or wizard you took this wand?

Mrs. Cattermole:
I didn't take it! I got it in Diagon Alley, at Ollivanders, when I was 11. It chose me!

Umbridge:
You're lying. Wands only choose witches, and you are not a witch.

Mrs. Cattermole:
But I am! [To Ron] Tell them, Reg! Tell them what I am! [Ron is silent] Reg, tell them what I am.

[Harry sees the locket, and his anger becomes too much. He withdraws his wand]

Umbridge:
What on earth are you doing, Albert?

Harry:
[As Runcorn] You're lying, Dolores... [Umbridge looks shocked, and Hermione tenses up] And one mustn't tell lies. Stupefy!

[He stuns Umbridge, knocking her out. Yaxley goes for his wand, but Ron gets there first and stuns him, while Hermione quickly scrabbles for the locket]

[Bellatrix holds Hermione and Griphook hostage]

Bellatrix:
[At Griphook] Consider yourself lucky, Goblin. [involving Hermione] The same won't be said for this one.

Ron Weasley:
Like hell! [charges upstairs to strike at Bellatrix] Expelliarmus!

Vernon Dursley:
This isn't just goodbye, boy, is it? This is farewell.

Dudley Dursley:
I don't understand. Isn't he coming with us?

Vernon Dursley:
Who?

Dudley Dursley:
Harry.

Vernon Dursley:
Absolutely not.

Dudley Dursley:
Why?

Vernon Dursley:
Why? [stammering] Because he doesn't want to. Do you, boy?

Harry Potter:
Absolutely not, no. Besides, I'm just a waste of space. Isn't that right, Vernon?

Vernon Dursley:
Come on Dudley. We're off.

[Dudley shakes Harry's hand]

Dudley Dursley:
I don't think you're a waste of space.

Harry Potter:
Thanks. [Dudley goes back to the car with his parents] [Smiles at Dudley] See you, Big D.

[Harry finds Aunt Petunia standing alone in the empty living room]

Aunt Petunia:
I have lived in this house for twenty years, and now in a single night, I'm expected to leave.

Harry Potter:
They'll torture you. If they think for a moment you know where I'm going, they'll stop at nothing.

Aunt Petunia:
[pause] You think I don't know what they're capable of? You didn't just lose a mother that night in Godric's Hollow, you know. I lost a sister. [leaves]

Hagrid:
[to Lupin as he holds Harry up against the wall of the Burrow with his hand and at wandpoint] Lupin!

Ginny:
What are you doing?

Hermione:
[to Ron and Harry before taking the Polyjuice potion that will transform them into Runcorn, Cattermole and Hopkirk, respectively] Right. Remember what we said, don't speak to anyone unless absolutely necessary. Just, try and act normal. Do what everybody else is doing. If we do that then with a bit of luck, we'll get inside. Then...

Harry:
It gets really tricky.

Hermione:
Correct.

Harry:
This is completely mental.

Hermione:
Completely.

Ron:
The world's mental. Come on, we've got a Horcrux to find.

[Ron walks into the elevator and sees Harry as Runcorn not recognizing that it’s him]

[Harry, Ron, and Hermione are in their tent, and Harry and Hermione are discussing a theory on how they could destroy the rest of the Horcruxes with the sword of Godric Gryffindor.]

Harry:
There's just one problem.

[Ron turns the lamp out with the Deluminator]

Harry:
How did you find us?

Ron:
[takes out the Deluminator] With this. It doesn't just turn off lights. I don't know how it works, but Christmas morning, I was sleeping in this little pub, keepin’ away from some Snatchers, and I heard it.

Harry:
It?

Ron:
A voice. Your voice, Hermione. Coming out of it.

Hermione:
[Her arms are folded as she says this] And what exactly did I say, may I ask?

Ron:
My name. Just my name. Like a whisper. So I took it, clicked it and this tiny ball of light appeared. And I knew. And sure enough, it floated towards me, the ball of light, right through my chest and straight through me. Right here. [he touches his heart] And I knew it was gonna take me where I needed to go.

[Hermione looks on, stunned]

Ron:
How long do you think she'll stay mad at me?

Harry:
Just keep talking about that little ball of light touching your heart, and she'll come 'round.

Ron:
It was true, every word. This is gonna sound crazy, but I think that's why Dumbledore left it to me, the Deluminator. I think he knew that somehow I'd need it to find my way back, and she'd lead me.

Harry:
You're not still mad at him, are you?

Hermione:
I'm always mad at him.

Luna Lovegood:
[takes Dobby’s hand before they Disapparate] Whenever you're ready, Sir.

Dobby the House Elf:
Sir? I like her very much.

[Dobby is unscrewing a chandelier from the ceiling and lets it crash to the floor causing Bellatrix to scream and move out of the way]

Bellatrix Lestrange:
You stupid elf! You could have killed me!

Dobby the House Elf:
Dobby never meant to kill! Dobby only meant to maim, or seriously injure!

[Dobby steals Narcissa’s wand with a snap of his finger]

Bellatrix Lestrange:
How dare you take a witch’s wand! How dare you defy your masters!

Dobby the House Elf:
Dobby has no master. Dobby is a free elf, and Dobby has come to save Harry Potter and his friends!

I have to hunt down these Horcuxes

Pius:
[Still under the Imperius Curse, addressing ministry employees] As your new Minister for Magic, I promise to restore this temple of tolerance to its former glory. Therefore, beginning today, each employee will submit themselves… for evaluation. But know this: you have nothing to fear if you have nothing to hide.

[last lines; Dobby has died in Harry's arms]

Luna:
We should close his eyes, don’t you think? [Harry nodd, and she does so, closing Dobby's eyes.] There. Now, he could be sleeping.

Harry:
[after a pause] I want to bury him. Properly, without magic.

[Harry and his friends bury Dobby on the beach and watch in sorrow. Meanwhile, back at Hogwarts, Voldemort succeeds in getting the Elder Wand.]

Harry Potter:
[Referring to Voldemort] The longer we stay here, the stronger he gets.

Harry Potter:
I told you everything Dumbledore told me. And in case you haven't noticed, we have found a Horcrux already.

Harry Potter:
[last lines, about Dobby] I want to bury him. Properly, without magic.

Ron Weasley:
[Referring to Hermione] We won't last two days without her. [pause] Don't tell her I said that.

Ron Weasley:
[after barely managing to destroy a horcrux] Just think. Only three more to go.

Ron Weasley:
[About Xenophilius] That treacherous little bleeder! Is there no one we can trust?

Hermione Granger:
If Voldemort really has taken over the Ministry, none of the old places are safe.

Hermione Granger:
Actually I'm highly logical which allows me to look past extraneous detail and perceive clearly that which others overlook.

Hermione Granger:
Forest of Dean. I came here once with Mum and Dad. That was years ago. It's just how I remember it. The trees, the river, everything. Like nothing's changed... not true of course. Everything's changed. If I brought them back here now, they'd probably not recognize any of it. Not the trees, not the river... not even me. [Pause] Maybe we should just stay here, Harry. Grow old... [Another pause] You wanted to know who the boy in the photograph was. I know. Gellert Grindlewald. [Hands Harry The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore]

Hermione Granger:
[angrily whacking Ron with a backpack with each word after he returns] You...complete...ARSE, Ronald Weasley! You show up here after WEEKS, and you say 'Hey'?!

Hermione Granger:
[Reading the Tale of the Three Brothers] There were once three brothers who were traveling along a lonely winding road, at twilight. In time, the brothers reached a river too treacherous to pass, but being learned in the magical arts, the three brothers simply waved their wands and made a bridge. Before they could cross, however, they found their path blocked by a hooded figure. It was Death, and he felt cheated. Cheated because travelers would normally drown in the river, but Death was cunning. He pretended to congratulate the three brothers on their magic and said that each had earned a prize for having been clever enough to evade him. The oldest asked for a wand more powerful than any in existence, so Death fashioned him one from an elder tree that stood nearby. The second brother decided he wanted to humiliate Death even further and asked for the power to recall loved ones from the grave, so Death plucked a stone from the river and offered it to him. Finally Death turned to the third brother. A humble man, he asked for something that would allow him to go forth from that place without being followed by Death. And so it was that Death reluctantly handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility. The first brother traveled to a distant village. While with the Elder Wand in hand, he killed a wizard with whom he had once quarreled. Drunk with the power that the Elder Wand had given him, he bragged of his invincibility. But that night, another wizard stole the wand and slit the brother's throat for good measure. And so Death took the first brother for his own. The second brother journeyed to his home, where he took the stone and turned it thrice in hand. To his delight, the girl he had once hoped to marry before her untimely death appeared before him. Yet soon she turned sad and cold, for she did not belong in the mortal world. Driven mad with hopeless longing, the second brother killed himself so as to join her. And so Death took the second brother. As for the third brother, Death searched for many years but was never able to find him. Only when he attained a great age did the youngest brother shed the Cloak of Invisibility and give it to his son. He then greeted Death as an old friend and went with him gladly, departing this life as equals.

Lord Voldemort:
As inspiring as I find your bloodlust, Bellatrix, I must be the one to kill Harry Potter.

Lord Voldemort:
To those of you who do not know. We are joined tonight by Ms. Charity Burbage, who until recently taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Her specialty was Muggle Studies. It is Ms. Burbage's belief that Muggles are not so different from us. She would, given her way, have us mate with them. To her, the mixture of magical and Muggle blood is not an abomination, but something to be encouraged.

Dobby The House Elf:
[last words] Such a beautiful place, to be with friends. Dobby is happy to be with his friend, Harry Potter.

Rufus Scrimgeour:
[First lines] These are dark times, there is no denying. Our world has perhaps faced no greater threat than it does today. But I say this to our citizenry: We, ever your servants, will continue to defend your liberty and repel the forces that seek to take it from you! Your Ministry remains...strong.

Neville Longbottom:
[Confronting Death Eaters on the train] Hey losers, he isn't here.

Luna Lovegood:
[to her father] Harry doesn't want to talk to us right now. He's just too polite to say so.

Luna Lovegood:
[to Harry] We should close his eyes, don't you think? [closes Dobby's eyes] There. Now he could be sleeping.

Xenophilius Lovegood:
[draws a line] The Elder Wand, the most powerful wand ever made. [draws a circle] The Resurrection Stone. [draws a triangle] The Cloak of Invisibility. Together, they make the Deathly Hallows. Together, they make one master of death.

Fred and George Weasley:
[after each taking a potion to make them look like Harry] Wow! We're identical!

Hermione Granger:
You're thinking there's a horcrux in Bellatrix's vault?

Hermione Granger:
He did save our lives twice. He kept an eye on us with that mirror. That doesn't sound like someone who's given up.

Ron Weasley:
(Hearing a roar in the distance) That doesn't sound good.

Ron Weasley:
(about saving Malfoy) If we die for them, Harry, I'm gonna kill you!

Ron Weasley:
We can end this.

Ron Weasley:
(After Hermione is attacked) Hey! That's my girlfriend, you numpties!

Ron Weasley:
(in Room of Requirement) AHHHHHH! Boyle's set the bloody place on fire!

Ron Weasley:
(About Griphook) That little git. Least we've still got Bogrod. (Bogrod gets incinerated by the dragon) That's unfortunate.

Lord Voldemort:
Harry Potter, the Boy who Lived... come to die. Avada Kedavra!

Lord Voldemort:
(to Nagini, speaking in Parseltongue) The boy has discovered our secret, Nagini. It makes us vulnerable. We must deploy all our forces now to find him. And you, my friend, must stay close.

Lord Voldemort:
They never learn. Pity.

Lord Voldemort:
(to Hogwarts' students) I know that many of you will want to fight. Some of you may even think that to fight is wise. But this is a folly. Give me Harry Potter. Do this and none shall be harmed. Give me Harry Potter, and I shall leave Hogwarts untouched. Give me Harry Potter, and you will be rewarded. You have one hour.

Lord Voldemort:
(trailer only) Why do you live?!

Lord Voldemort:
(to Nagini) Come, Nagini. I need to keep you safe.

Lord Voldemort:
You have fought valiantly, but in vain. I do not wish this. Every drop of magical blood spilled is a terrible waste. I therefore command my forces to retreat. In their absence, dispose of your dead with dignity. Harry Potter, I now speak directly to you. On this night, you have allowed your friends to die for you, rather than face me yourself. There is no greater dishonor. Join me in the Forbidden Forest, and confront your fate. If you do not do this, I shall kill every last man, woman and child who tries to conceal you from me.

Lord Voldemort:
(to Snape) ...only I can live forever.

Minerva McGonagall:
(After using the spell Piertotum Locomotor to bring the statues to life and fight; excited) I've always wanted to use that spell!

Minerva McGonagall:
Hogwarts is threatened! Man the boundaries, protect us! Do your duty to our school!

Minerva McGonagall:
Do what you have to do. I'll secure the castle.

Minerva McGonagall:
(To Filch when he asks where to send the Slytherin students) The dungeons will do.

Minerva McGonagall:
(Speaking to Neville Longbottom about getting Seamus to blow up parts of the castle) As I recall, he has a particular proclivity for pyrotechnics.

Severus Snape:
Many of you are surely wondering why I have summoned you at this hour. It's come to my attention that earlier this evening, Harry Potter was sighted in Hogsmeade. Now, should anyone, student or staff, attempt to aid Mr. Potter, they will be punished, in a manner consistent with the severity of their transgression. Furthermore, any person found to have knowledge of these events... who fails to come forward, will be treated... as... equally guilty.

Severus Snape:
(last words, to Harry) Look at me. You have your mother's eyes. (dies)

Severus Snape:
Lily, After all this time(Dumbledore to Snape), Always

Lily Potter:
Harry, you are so loved, so loved. (Whispering) Harry, Mama loves you. Dada loves you. Harry, be safe. Be strong.

Molly Weasley:
(in anger towards Bellatrix) NOT MY DAUGHTER, YOU B*TCH!

Neville Longbottom:
(to Voldemort's Death Eaters, after they try to get through the shield, but can't) Yeah! You and whose army?!

Helena Ravenclaw:
If you have to ask, you'll never know. If you know, you need only ask.

Neville Longbottom:
(climbing onto the bridge after blowing it up) That went well.

Ollivander:
He's after you, Mr. Potter. If it's true what you say and he (Voldemort) has found the Elder Wand, I'm afraid you really don't stand a chance.

Harry Potter:
I suppose I'll have to kill him before he finds me, then.

Hermione Granger:
(disguised as Bellatrix Lestrange, addressing a Death Eater) Good morning!

Griphook:
Good morning? Good morning? You're Bellatrix Lestrange, not some dewey-eyed schoolgirl!

Ron:
Oi! Watch it!

Hermione:
No! He's right! I was being stupid!

Hermione Granger:
We can't just stand here. Who's got an idea?

Ron Weasley:
You're the brilliant one!

Harry Potter:
He knows. You-Know-Who. He knows we broke into Gringotts, he knows what we took, and he knows we're hunting Horcruxes.

Hermione Granger:
How is it you know?

Harry Potter:
I saw him.

Hermione Granger:
You let him in? Harry, you can't do that!

Harry Potter:
Hermione, I can't always help it! Well, maybe I can, I don't know.

Ron Weasley:
Never mind, what happened?

Harry Potter:
Well, he's angry, and scared too. He knows if we find and destroy all the Horcruxes, we'll be able to kill him. I reckon he'll stop at nothing to make sure we don't find the rest. There's more. One of them's at Hogwarts.

Hermione Granger:
What? You saw it?

Harry Potter:
I saw the castle. And Rowena Ravenclaw. They must have something to do with her. We have to go there, now.

Hermione Granger:
What? We can't do that! We've got to plan! We've got to figure it out...

Harry Potter:
Hermione, when have any of our plans ever actually worked? We plan, we get there, all hell breaks loose!

Ron Weasley:
He's right. One problem, Snape's headmaster now, we can't just walk in through the front door.

Harry Potter:
Well, we'll go to Hogsmeade, to Honeyduke's. Take the secret passage in the cellar. It's... there's something wrong with him. It's like, you know, in the past, I've always been able to follow his thoughts. And now, everything just feels disconnected.

Ron Weasley:
Maybe it's the Horcruxes. Maybe he's growing weaker, maybe he's dying.

Harry Potter:
No. No, it's more like he's wounded. If anything, he feels more dangerous.

Aberforth Dumbledore:
Bloody fools, what were you thinking coming here? Have you any idea of how dangerous it is?

Harry Potter:
Aberforth, Dumbledore's brother. It's you that I've been seeing in here. You're the one who sent Dobby.

Aberforth Dumbledore:
Where have you left him?

Harry Potter:
He's dead.

Aberforth Dumbledore:
Sorry to hear it. I liked that elf.

Harry Potter:
Who gave that to you? The mirror?

Aberforth Dumbledore:
Mundungus Fletcher. About a year ago.

Harry Potter:
Dung had no right sending it to you. It belongs to...

Aberforth Dumbledore:
Sirius. Albus told me. He also told me you'd likely be hacked off if you ever found out that I had it, but ask yourself: where would you be if I didn't? [Gives the trio some food]

Hermione Granger:
Do you hear from the others much? From the Order?

Aberforth Dumbledore:
The Order's finished. You-Know-Who's won. Anyone who says otherwise is killing themselves.

Harry Potter:
We need to get into Hogwarts, tonight. Dumbledore gave us a job to do.

Aberforth Dumbledore:
Did he now? Nice job? Easy?

Harry Potter:
We've been hunting Horcruxes. We think the last one's inside the castle, but we'll need your help in getting in.

Aberforth Dumbledore:
It's not a job my brother's given you. It's a suicide mission. Do yourself a favor, boy, and go home. Live a little longer.

Harry Potter:
Dumbledore trusted me to see this through.

Aberforth Dumbledore:
What makes you think you can trust him? What makes you think you can believe anything my brother told you? In all the time you knew him, did he ever mention my name? Did he ever mention hers?

Harry Potter:
Why should he...

Aberforth Dumbledore:
...Keep secrets, you tell me?

Harry Potter:
I trusted him.

Aberforth Dumbledore:
That's a boy's answer. A boy who goes chasing Horcruxes on the word of a man who wouldn't even tell you where to start. You're lying! Not just to me, it doesn't matter, but to yourself as well. That's what a fool does. You don't strike me as a fool, Harry Potter. So, I'll ask you again, there must be a reason.

Harry Potter:
I'm not interested in what happened between you and your brother. I don't care that you've given up. I trusted the man I knew. We need to get into the castle tonight.

[Neville has came from the passageway of the Hog's Head]

Harry Potter:
Neville. You look...

Neville Longbottom:
Like hell, I reckon. This is nothing. Seamus is worse. [To Aberforth, carrying a bottle] Hey Ab, we got a couple more coming through.

Ginny Weasley:
[sees Harry] Harry!

Harry Potter:
Hi there.

Ron Weasley:
Six months she hasn't see me, it's like I'm a Frankie First Year. I'm only her brother...

Seamus Finnigan:
She's got lots of them, but only one Harry.

Ron Weasley:
Shut up, Seamus.

Neville Longbottom:
Right then, so what's the plan, Harry?

Harry Potter:
Okay, there's something we need to find, something hidden here in the castle, and it may help us defeat You-Know-Who.

Neville Longbottom:
Right, what is it?

Harry Potter:
We don't know.

Dean Thomas:
Where is it?

Harry Potter:
We don't know that either. I realize that's not much to go on.

Seamus Finnigan:
That's nothing to go on.

Professor Severus Snape:
[to the Hogwart's students] If anyone here knows any knowledge of Mr. Potter's movements this evening, I invite them to step forward... now.

[There is a long pause, as the assembled students just stare at the ground in terror. Harry then steps out from the crowd, causing audible gasps from everyone present]

Harry Potter:
[coldly] It seems despite your exhaustive defensive strategies, you still have a bit of a security problem, Headmaster. [Order members enter] And I'm afraid it's quite extensive. How dare you stand where he (Dumbledore) stood. Tell them how it happened that night! How you looked him in the eye, a man who trusted you, and killed him!

Argus Filch:
[running in with a lantern yelling] STUDENTS OUT OF BED! Students out of bed! Students in the corridor!

Minerva McGonagall:
[snapping] They're supposed to be out of bed, you blithering idiot!

Argus Filch:
Oh, sorry, ma'am.

Minerva McGonagall:
As it happens, Mr Filch, your arrival is most opportune. If you would, i would like you to lead Miss Parkinson and the rest of Slytherin House from the Hall!

Argus Filch:
[about the Slytherin students] Where exactly is it I'll be leading them to, ma'am?

Minerva McGonagall:
The dungeons will do.

Neville Longbottom:
[walking with McGonagall and Seamus] Let me get this straight, Professor. [grabs her arm] You're actually giving us permission to do this?

Minerva McGonagall:
[rolls her eyes] That is correct, Longbottom.

Neville Longbottom:
[stops her] To blow it up? [exited] Boom?

Minerva McGonagall:
[yells] Boom!

Neville Longbottom:
[laughing] Wicked. [then turns serious, Seamus starts laughing] But how on earth are we gonna do that?

Minerva McGonagall:
[sarcastically] Why don't you confer with Mr. Finnigan? [Seamus stops laughing] As I recall, he has a particular proclivity for pyrotechnics.

Seamus Finnigan:
[nodding] I can bring her down.

Minerva McGonagall:
[excited] That's the spirit. [shooing them away] Off you go.

Filius Flitwick:
You do realize, of course, we can't keep out You-Know-Who indefinitely.

Minerva McGonagall:
That doesn't mean we can't delay him. And his name is Voldemort. Filius, you might as well use it. He's going to try to kill you either way.

Remus Lupin:
It is the quality of one's convictions that determines success, not the number of followers.

Kingsley Shacklebolt:
Who said that?

Remus Lupin:
Me.

George Weasley:
You okay, Freddie?

Fred Weasley:
Yeah.

George Weasley:
Me too.

Luna Lovegood:
Harry, wait, I need to talk to you.

Harry Potter:
I'm a bit preoccupied at the moment, Luna.

Luna Lovegood:
You won't find it where you're going, you're wasting your time.

Harry Potter:
We'll talk later, okay, Luna?

Luna Lovegood:
Harry!

Harry Potter:
Later!

Luna Lovegood:
[shouting] Harry Potter! You listen to me right now! [calmer] Don't you remember what Cho said about Rowena Ravenclaw's diadem? There's not a person alive who's seen it. It's obvious, isn't it? You have to talk to someone who's dead.

Harry Potter:
You're the Grey Lady. The Ghost of Ravenclaw Tower.

Helena Ravenclaw:
I do not answer to that name.

Harry Potter:
No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's Helena, isn't it? Helena Ravenclaw. Rowena's daughter.

Helena Ravenclaw:
Are you a friend of Luna's?

Harry Potter:
Yes. And she thought you might be able to help me.

Helena Ravenclaw:
You seek my mother's diadem.

Harry Potter:
Yes. That's right.

Helena Ravenclaw:
Luna is kind, unlike so many of the others. But she was wrong. I cannot help you.

Harry Potter:
Wait! Please! I want to destroy it.

Harry Potter:
[yelling] Ginny! Neville! Are you all right?

Neville Longbottom:
Never better! I feel like I could spit fire! You haven't seen Luna, have you?

Harry Potter:
Luna?

Neville Longbottom:
I'm mad for her. I think it's about time I told her, since we'll probably both be dead by dawn!

[Seeing the truth in his words, Ginny and Harry kiss passionately, before Harry runs off to the Room of Requirement]

Draco Malfoy:
[points his wand at Harry] Well, well. What brings you here, Potter?

Harry Potter:
Might ask you the same.

Draco Malfoy:
You have something of mine. I'd like it back.

Harry Potter:
[Nudging to his wand] Well, what's wrong with the one you have?

Draco Malfoy:
It's my mother's, it's powerful but it's... not the same. It doesn't quite... understand. You know what I mean?

Harry Potter:
Why didn't you tell her? Bellatrix? You knew it was me. But you didn't say anything.

Lucius Malfoy:
My Lord, might it be less... Might it not be more prudent to call off this attack? Simply seek the boy yourself?

Lord Voldemort:
I do not need to seek the boy. Before the night is out, he will come to me! Do you understand?! Look at me! How can you live with yourself, Lucius?

Lucius Malfoy:
I... I don't know.

Lord Voldemort:
Go and find Severus. Bring him to me.

Severus Snape:
You have performed extraordinary magic with this wand, my Lord, in the last few hours alone.

Lord Voldemort:
No. No, I am extraordinary, but the wand... resists me.

Severus Snape:
There is no wand more powerful, Ollivander himself has said. Tonight, when the boy comes, it will not fail you, I am sure of it. It answers to you, and you only.

Lord Voldemort:
Does it?

Severus Snape:
My Lord...

Lord Voldemort:
The wand, does it truly answer to me? You're a clever man, Severus. Surely, you must know. Where does its true loyalty lie?

Severus Snape:
With you, of course, my Lord.

Lord Voldemort:
The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly because I am not its true master. The Elder Wand belongs to the wizard who killed its last owner. You killed Dumbledore, Severus. While you live, the Elder Wand cannot truly be mine. You've been a good and faithful servant, Severus, but only I can live..forever.

Severus Snape:
My Lord... [Voldemort slashes with his wand and cuts Snape's throat; blood spills; Severus falls onto the window]

Lord Voldemort:
Nagini, kill. [Nagini repeatedly bites Snape, mortally wounding him]

[Severus Snape is having a conversation with Dumbledore. Snape is touching Dumbledore's hand]

Severus Snape:
It will contain a curse to your hand for the time being. It will spread, Albus.

Albus Dumbledore:
How long?

Severus Snape:
Maybe a year.

[Snape turns to leave, but Dumbledore stops him]

Albus Dumbledore:
Don't ignore me, Severus. We both know Lord Voldemort has ordered the Malfoy boy to murder me. But should he fail, one should presume that the Dark Lord would turn to you. You must be the one to kill me, Severus. It is the only way. Only then, will the Dark Lord trust you completely. [We see Dumbledore being killed by Snape, as shown in Half-Blood Prince] There will come a time when Harry Potter must be told something, but you must wait until Lord Voldemort is at his most vulnerable.

Severus Snape:
Must be told what?

[As Dumbledore speaks, we see a worried Snape running inside the Potter home]

Albus Dumbledore:
On the night Lord Voldemort went to Godric's Hollow to kill Harry, and Lily Potter cast herself between them, the curse rebounded. When that happened, a part of Voldemort's soul latched itself onto the only living thing that it could find: Harry himself. There is a reason Harry can speak with snakes. There is a reason he could look into Voldemort's mind. A part of Voldemort lives inside him.

Severus Snape:
So, when the time comes...the boy must die?

Albus Dumbledore:
Yes, yes, he must die.

[We see Snape arrive in Harry's bedroom and collapsing in horror at the sight of Lily's dead body]

Severus Snape:
You've kept him so he can die at the proper moment. You've been raising him like a pig for slaughter.

Albus Dumbledore:
Don't tell me now that you've grown to care for the boy. [Snape casts a deer Patronus, the same one that helped Harry find the Sword of Gryffindor in Part 1] Lily? [A crying Snape is shown holding Lily's body] After all this time?

Severus Snape:
Always. So, when the time comes...the boy must die?

Albus Dumbledore:
Yes, he must die. And Voldemort himself must do it. That is essential.

Harry Potter:
Why are you here, all of you?

Lily Potter:
We never left.

Harry Potter:
Does it hurt, dying?

Sirius Black:
Quicker than falling asleep.

James Potter:
You're nearly there, son.

Harry Potter:
I'm sorry. I never wanted any of you to die for me. And Remus, your son...

Remus Lupin:
Others will tell him what his mother and father died for. One day, he'll understand.

Harry Potter:
You'll stay with me?

James Potter:
Until the end.

Harry Potter:
And he (Voldemort) won't be able to see you?

Sirius Black:
No. We're here, you see.

Harry Potter:
Stay close to me.

Lily Potter:
Always.

Albus Dumbledore:
Harry, you brave, brave man. Let us walk.

Harry Potter:
Professor, what is that?

Albus Dumbledore:
Something beyond either of our help. A part of Voldemort, sent here to die.

Harry Potter:
And exactly where are we?

Albus Dumbledore:
I was going to ask you that. Where would you say that we are?

Harry Potter:
Well, it looks like King's Cross Station, only cleaner, and without all the trains.

Albus Dumbledore:
King's Cross, is that right? This is, as they say, your parting. I expect you now realize that you and Lord Voldemort had been connected by something other than fate, since that night in Godric's Hollow all those years ago.

Harry Potter:
So it's true then, isn't it, Sir? A part of him lives inside me?

Albus Dumbledore:
Did. It was just destroyed many moments ago by none other than Lord Voldemort himself. You were the Horcux he never meant to make, Harry.

Harry Potter:
I have to go back, haven't I?

Albus Dumbledore:
Oh, that's up to you.

Harry Potter:
I have a choice?

Albus Dumbledore:
Oh, yes. We're in King's Cross, you say? I think if you so desired, you'd be able to board a train.

Harry Potter:
And where would it take me?

Albus Dumbledore:
On.

Harry Potter:
Voldemort has the Elder Wand.

Albus Dumbledore:
True.

Harry Potter:
And the snake's still alive.

Albus Dumbledore:
Yes.

Harry Potter:
And I've nothing to kill it with.

Albus Dumbledore:
Help will always be given at Hogwarts, Harry, to those who ask for it. I've always prized myself on my ability to turn a phrase. Words are, in my not so humble opinion, our most inexhaustible source of magic. Capable of both inflicting injury, and remedying it. But I would, in this case, amend my original statement to this: Help would always be given at Hogwarts, to those who deserve it. Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living. And above all, those who live without love.

Harry Potter:
Professor, my mother's Patronus was a doe, wasn't it? It's the same as Professor Snape's It's curious, don't you think?

Albus Dumbledore:
Actually, if I think about it, it doesn't seem curious at all. I'll be going now, Harry. [turns to leave]

Harry Potter:
Professor? Is this all real? Or is it just happening inside my head?

Albus Dumbledore:
Of course it's happening inside your head, Harry. Why should that mean that it's not real?

Harry Potter:
Professor, what shall I do? Professor?

Ginny Weasley:
Who is that? Hagrid's carrying? Neville, who is it?

Lord Voldemort:
Harry Potter... is dead!

Ginny Weasley:
No! No!

Lord Voldemort:
Silence! [fires a spell towards Ginny, causing her to back down] Stupid girl. Harry Potter is dead. [to Hogwarts' assembled] From this day forth, you put your faith... in me. [to Death Eaters] Harry Potter is dead! [He and his Death Eaters laugh] And now, it is the time to declare yourself. Come forward and join us... or die.

Lucius Malfoy:
Draco! Draco.

Narcissa Malfoy:
Draco, come.

[Reluctantly, Draco walks over to Voldemort, who hugs him]

Lord Voldemort:
Well done, Draco. Well done. [Draco walks to his parents. Neville comes forward] Well, I must say, I hoped for better. [Death Eaters laugh] And who might you be, young man?

Neville Longbottom:
Neville Longbottom. [Death Eaters laugh]

Bellatrix Lestrange:
Ha-ha!

Lord Voldemort:
Well, Neville, I'm sure we can find a place for you in our ranks.

Neville Longbottom:
I'd like to say something.

Lord Voldemort:
Well, Neville, I'm sure we'd all be fascinated to hear what you have to say.

Neville Longbottom:
It doesn't matter that Harry's gone.

Seamus Finnigan:
Stand down, Neville.

Neville Longbottom:
People die every day. Friends, family. Yeah, we lost Harry tonight. But he's still with us, in here. [gestures to chest] So's Fred, and Remus, Tonks... all of them. They didn't die in vain. [to Voldemort] But you will, 'cause you're wrong! Harry's heart did beat for us, for all of us! It's not over!

[He draws the Sword of Gryffindor, Harry wakes up, jumps out of Hagrid's arms, and pulls out his wand, much to Voldemort's shock]

Harry Potter:
Confringo!

[He fires a spell at Voldemort's snake, Nagini, but it reflects onto the Death Eaters. As Harry begins to run, Voldemort, now enraged, fires several curses at Harry. As he does, some of his Death Eaters begin to retreat]

Bellatrix Lestrange:
[her last words] No! No, come back! Lucius! Come on! Come on and fight!

[Some Death Eaters continue to retreat, but many stay behind to join Voldemort, who is about to charge the castle]

Harry Potter:
[to Ron, Hermione, and Neville] I'll lure him into the castle! We have to kill the snake.

Hermione Granger:
[to Neville] You'll need this!

[Neville prepares to fight with the sword]

Arthur Weasley:
Neville!

Lord Voldemort:
NO!! [Fires a curse on Neville, sending him flying. Voldemort and Nagini disappear, while Lucius, Draco, and Narcissa leave Hogwarts]

[During Harry and Voldemort's final duel]

Harry Potter:
Hey, you were right. When you told Professor Snape that wand was failing you, it will always fail you.

Lord Voldemort:
[his last words] Yah! I killed Snape!

Harry Potter:
But what if that wand never belonged to Snape? What if its allegiance was always to someone else? Come on, Tom, let's finish this the way we started: TOGETHER! [Throws himself and Voldemort off the roof]

[Harry, Ron and Hermione are walking on the damaged Viaduct after Voldemort's death]

Hermione Granger:
Why didn't it work for him? The Elder Wand?

Harry Potter:
It answered to somebody else. When he killed Snape, he thought the Wand would become his, but the thing is, the Wand never belonged to Snape. It was Draco who disarmed Dumbledore that night at the Astronomy Tower. From that moment on, the Wand answered to him, until... the other night, when I disarmed Draco at Malfoy Manor.

Ron Weasley:
So that means...

Harry Potter:
It's mine.

Ron Weasley:
What do you reckon we should do with it?

Hermione Granger:
We?

Ron Weasley:
I'm just saying, that's the Elder Wand, the most powerful wand in the world. With that, we'd be invincible.

[Harry, after thinking for a moment, breaks the Wand in two, and throws it away]

[Last lines]

Albus Severus Potter:
Dad, what if I am put in Slytherin?

Harry Potter:
Albus Severus Potter, you were named after two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin and he was the bravest man I've ever known.

Albus Severus Potter:
But just say that I am.

Harry Potter:
Then Slytherin House will have gained a wonderful, young wizard. But, listen, if it really means that much to you, you can choose Gryffindor. The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account.

Albus Severus Potter:
Really?

Harry Potter:
Really. [Train whistle blows] Ready?

Albus Severus Potter:
[Last line] Ready.

Albus Dumbledore:

After all this time?

Severus Snape:

Always.

Dumbledore:
Of course it’s all happening in your head, Harry, but why should that mean it is not real.

Harry Potter:
[Referring to Voldemort] The longer we stay here, the stronger he gets.

Harry Potter:
[to Ron and Hermione while Dobby lies dying] HELP ME!

Harry Potter:
[last lines] I want to bury him. Properly, without magic.

Hermione Granger:
If Voldemort really has taken over the Ministry, none of the old places are safe.

Hermione Granger:
[Whacking Ron with a backpack with each word after he returns] You-complete-arse, Ronald Weasley! You show up here after weeks, and you say 'Hey'?

Hermione Granger:
Ron got splinched!

Hermione Granger:
[Image from the Horcrux] Who could look at you next to the famous Harry Potter?

Hermione Granger:
Forest of Dean. I came here once with Mum and Dad. That was years ago. It's just how I remember it. The trees, the river, everything. Like nothing's changed... not true of course. Everything's changed. If I brought them back here now, they'd probably not recognize any of it. Not the trees, not the river... not even me. [Pause] Maybe we should just stay here, Harry. Grow old... [Another pause] You wanted to know who the boy in the photograph was. I know. Gellert Grindlewald. [Hands Harry The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore]

Hermione Granger:
There were once three brothers who were traveling along a lonely winding road at twilight. In time, the brothers reached a river too treacherous to pass but being learned in the magical arts, the three brothers simply waved their wands and made a bridge. Before they could cross, however, they found their path blocked by a hooded figure. It was Death and he felt cheated. Cheated because travelers would normally drown in the river, but Death was cunning. He pretended to congratulate the three brothers on their magic and said that each had earned a prize for having been clever enough to evade him. The oldest asked for a wand more powerful than any in existence so Death fashioned him one from an elder tree that stood nearby. The second brother decided he wanted to humiliate Death even further and asked for the power to recall loved ones from the grave so Death plucked a stone from the river and offered it to him. Finally Death turned to the third brother. A humble man, he asked for something that would allow him to go forth from that place without being followed by Death. And so it was that Death reluctantly handed over his own cloak of invisibility. The first brother traveled to a distant village while with the Elder Wand in hand, he killed a wizard with whom he had once quarreled. Drunk with the power that the Elder Wand had given him, he bragged of his invincibility. But that night, another wizard stole the wand and slit the brother's throat for good measure. And so Death took the first brother for his own. The second brother journeyed to his home where he took the stone and turned it thrice in hand. To his delight, the girl he once hoped to marry before her untimely death appeared before him. Yet soon she turned sad and cold for she did not belong in the mortal world. Driven mad with hopeless longing, the second brother killed himself so as to join her. And so Death took the second brother. As for the third brother, Death searched for many years but was never able to find him only when he attained a great age did the youngest brother shed the Cloak of Invisibility and give it to his son. He then he greeted Death as an old friend and went with him gladly, departing this life as equals.

Hermione Granger:
We forgot to celebrate your birthday Harry! Ginny and I, we prepared a cake! We were going to bring it out at the end of the wedding!

Hermione Granger:
Shaftesbury Avenue. I used to come to the theatre here with mum and dad. I don't know why I thought of that, it just popped into my head.

Hermione Granger:
To Harry! It belongs to Harry. It came to him when he most needed it in the Chamber of Secrets.

Hermione Granger:
I've had all the essentials packed for days, just in case.

Ron Weasley:
[Referring to Hermione] We won't last two days without her. [pause] Don't tell her I said that.

Ron Weasley:
[about Hermione's copy of The Tales Of Beedle The Bard] Mum used to read those to me as a kid! The Wizard and the Hopping Pot, Babbity Rabbity And Her Cackling Stump... [Harry and Hermione both look lost] Come on! Babitty Rabbity... No?

Ron Weasley:
[after barely managing to destroy a horcrux] Just think. Only three more to go.

Ron Weasley:
The deluminator. It doesn't just turn off lights. I don't know how it worked but Christmas morning, I was sleeping in this little pub, keeping away from some Snatchers, and I heard it. A voice. Your voice, Hermione. You said my name. Just my name. Like a whisper. So I took it, clicked it and this tiny ball of light appeared. And I knew. It flew towards me, the ball of light, right through my chest and straight through me. Right here. [touches his heart] And I knew it was going to take me where I needed to go.

Ron Weasley:
[About Xenophilius] That treacherous little bleeder! Is there no one we can trust?

Lord Voldemort:
As inspiring as I find your blood-lust, Bellatrix, I must be the one to kill Harry Potter.

Lord Voldemort:
[to Ron via Horcrux] I have seen your heart, and it is mine.

Lord Voldemort:
To those of you who do not know. We are joined tonight by Ms. Charity Burbage, who until recently taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Her specialty was Muggle Studies. It is Ms. Burbage's belief that Muggles are not so different from us. She would, given her way, have us mate with them. Such behavior, in her eyes, is not an abomination, but something to be encouraged.

Dobby the House Elf:
[After Luna calls him, Sir] Sir? I like her very much!

Dobby the House Elf:
[After dropping a chandelier from the ceiling] Dobby did not mean to kill anyone! Dobby only meant to maim, or seriously injure!

Dobby the House Elf:
(when yelled at by Bellatrix about defying his masters) Dobby has no master. Dobby is a free elf, and Dobby has come to save Harry Potter and his friends!

Dobby the House Elf:
[last words] Such a beautiful place, to be with friends. Dobby is happy to be with his friend, Harry Potter.

Rufus Scrimgeour:
[First lines] These are dark times, there is no denying. Our world has perhaps faced no greater threat than it does today. But I say this to our citizenry: We, ever your servants, will continue to defend your liberty and repel the forces that seek to take it from you! Your Ministry remains, strong.

Neville Longbottom:
[Confronting Death Eaters on the train] Hey losers, he isn't here.

Luna Lovegood:
[to her father] Harry doesn't want to talk to us right now. He's just too polite to say so.

Xenophilius Lovegood:
[draws a line] The Elder Wand, the most powerful wand ever made. [draws a circle] The Resurrection Stone. [draws a triangle] The Cloak of Invisibility. Together, they make the Deathly Hallows. Together, they make one master of death.

Cormac McLaggen:
[Confronted with Death Eaters on the train to Hogwarts] My father will hear about this.

Lucius Malfoy:
[To Scabior] You dare to talk to me like that in my own house?!

Fred and George Weasley:
[after each taking a potion to make them look like Harry] Wow! We're identical!

Ginny Weasley:
[while Harry zips her dress up] Seems silly, doesn't it? A wedding. Given everything that's going on.

Harry Potter:
Maybe that's the best reason to have it. Because of everything that's going on.

[She turns to him and they kiss. George sneaks into the kitchen silently; he stirs a cup of tea and sticks the spoon in the hole where his ear was.]

George Weasley:
[after Ginny spots him and stopped kissing Harry] Morning.

Hermione Granger:
[upon arriving at Godric's Hollow] We should have taken Polyjuice.

Harry Potter:
No... this is where I was born. I won't return as someone else.

Harry Potter:
This is mental.

Hermione Granger:
Completely.

Ron Weasley:
The world's mental.

Alastor 'Mad-Eye' Moody:
Potter, you're underage, which means you still have the Trace on you.

Harry Potter:
What's the Trace?

Alastor 'Mad-Eye' Moody:
If you sneeze, the Ministry will know who wipes your nose. Point is, we'll have to use those means of transport the Trace can't detect: Brooms, Thestrals, and the like; we'll go in pairs. That way if anyone's out there waiting for us, and I reckon there will be... they won't know which Harry Potter is the real one.

Harry Potter:
The real one?

Alastor 'Mad-Eye' Moody:
[brings out Polyjuice Potion] I reckon that you're familiar with this particular brew.

Harry Potter:
[recognizes it] No, absolutely not.

Hermione Granger:
Told you he'd take it well.

Alastor 'Mad-Eye' Moody:
For those of you who haven't taken Polyjuice Potion before, fair warning: It tastes like goblin piss.

Fred Weasley:
Have lots of experience with that, do you, Mad-Eye? ...Just trying to diffuse the tension.

Kingsley Shacklebolt:
[pointing his wand at Lupin] The last words that Albus Dumbledore said to the pair of us?

Remus Lupin:
Harry is the best hope we have. Trust him.

Lord Voldemort:
Severus. I was beginning to worry that you had lost your way. Come, we've saved you a seat. You bring news, I trust?

Severus Snape:
It will happen Saturday next, at nightfall.

Yaxley:
I heard differently, my Lord. Dawlish, the Auror, has let slip that the Potter boy will not be moved until the 30th of this month, the day before he turns 17.

Severus Snape:
This is a false trail. The Auror office no longer plays any part in the protection of Harry Potter.

Fred Weasley:
[walking into burrow and seeing the injured George] George! How do you feel?

George Weasley:
[quietly] Saint-like.

Fred Weasley:
[confused pause] Come again?

George Weasley:
Saint like. I'm holy... [Points to spot where his ear is missing] Holey, get it?

Fred Weasley:
[laughs quietly] The whole world of ear-related humor, and you go for, I'm holy? You're pathetic.

George Weasley:
Reckon I'm still better looking than you.

Lord Voldemort:
What say you, Pius?

Pius Thicknesse:
One hears many things my Lord, as if the truth is among them is not clear.

Lord Voldemort:
Ha! Spoken like a true politician. You will, I think, prove most useful, Pius.

[Harry, Ron, and Hermione are in their tent, and Harry and Hermione are discussing a theory on how they could destroy the rest of the Horcruxes with the sword of Godric Gryffindor.]

Harry Potter:
There's just one problem.

Ron Weasley:
The sword was stolen. [Walks up, turns the lamp back on with his Deluminator. Ron has a stony look on his face.] Yeah. I'm still here. But you two carry on. Don't let me spoil your fun.

Harry Potter:
What's wrong?

Ron Weasley:
Well, nothing's wrong. Not according to you, anyway.

Harry Potter:
Look, if you've got something to say, don't be shy. Spit it out.

Ron Weasley:
All right, I'll spit it out. But don't expect me to be grateful just because now there's another damn thing we've gotta find.

Harry Potter:
I thought you knew what you signed up for!

Ron Weasley:
Yeah. I thought I did, too.

Harry Potter:
Well then, I'm sorry, but I don't quite understand. What part of this isn't living up to your expectations? Did you think we were gonna be staying in a five-star hotel? Finding a Horcrux every other day? You thought you'd be back with your mum by Christmas?

Ron Weasley:
I just thought after all this time we would have actually achieved something! I thought you knew what you were doing! I thought Dumbledore would've told you something worthwhile! I thought you had a plan!

Harry Potter:
I told you everything Dumbledore told me! And in case you haven't noticed, we have found a Horcrux already.

Ron Weasley:
[bitterly] Yeah and we're about as close to getting rid of it as we are to finding the rest of them, aren't we?

Hermione Granger:
[trying to intervene] Ron, please. [She tries to take the locket off of Ron, but he angrily shoves her away] Please take the Horcrux off! You won't be saying any of this if you hadn't been wearing it all day!

Ron Weasley:
You don't know why I listen to that radio every night, do ya? To make sure I don't hear Ginny's name. Or Fred, or George, or Mum--

Harry Potter:
What, you think I'm not listening too? You think I don't know how this feels?!

Ron Weasley:
No, you don't know how it feels! Your parents are dead! You have no family!

[Furious at what Ron just said, Harry attacks him]

Hermione Granger:
Stop! Stop! [pulls the boys apart]

Harry Potter:
Fine then, go!! Go then!

[Ron wrenches the locket off and gets his bag]

Hermione Granger:
Ron...

Ron Weasley:
[turns to Hermione] And you? Are you coming or are you staying?

[Hermione looks torn; she glances from Harry to Ron in shock]

Ron Weasley:
Fine. I get it. I saw you two the other night.

Hermione Granger:
[tears in her eyes] Ron, that's - that's nothing!

Ron Weasley:
How long do you think she'll stay mad at me?

Harry Potter:
Just keep talking about that little ball of light touching your heart, and she'll come 'round.

Fred and George:
[disguised as Harry] Wow, we're identical!

Moody:
Not yet, you're not.

Harry Potter:
[about Ron, after he returns] You're not still mad at him, are you?

Hermione Granger:
I'm always mad at him.

Dobby the House Elf:
[in the kitchen at Grimmauld Place] And then Dobby saw Kreacher talking to the thief Mundungus...

Mundungus Fletcher:
[interrupting] I'm not a thief! You foul little... git! I'm a buyer and purveyor of valuable and wondrous objects.

Ron Weasley:
You're a thief, Dung, everyone knows it!

Remus Lupin:
What creature sat in the corner the first time Harry Potter visited my office in Hogwarts?

Harry Potter:
ARE YOU MAD?

Remus Lupin:
WHAT CREATURE!?

Harry Potter:
A Grindylow!

Remus Lupin:
[releases Harry] We've been betrayed. Voldemort knew you were coming tonight. I had to make sure you're not an impostor.

Kingsley Shacklebolt:
What gave you away?

Harry Potter:
Hedwig, I think. She was trying to protect me.

Ron Weasley:
[[as Cattermole] Morning.

Harry Potter:
[as Runcorn] Ron, it's me.

Ron Weasley:
[as Cattermole] Harry! Blimey, forgot what you look like. Where's Hermione?

Harry Potter:
[as Runcorn] She's gone down to the courtrooms, with Umbridge.

Ron Weasley:
[as Cattermole] Oh, my God. What am I gonna do? My wife's all alone downstairs.

Harry Potter:
[as Runcorn] Ron, you don't have a wife.

Ron Weasley:
[as Cattermole] Oh, right.

Yaxley:
Cattermole. It's still raining inside my office. That's two days now.

Ron Weasley:
[as Cattermole] Have you tried an umbrella?

[Umbridge is presiding over Mrs. Cattermole's Hearing, while Harry (disguised as Albert Runcorn), witnesses, Ron (disguised as her husband, Reg), takes his place beside her, and Hermione (disguised as Mafalda Hopkirk) records the minutes]

Umbridge:
Mary Elizabeth Cattermole?

Mrs. Cattermole:
Yes?

Umbridge:
A wand was taken from you upon your arrival at the Ministry today, Mrs. Cattermole. [holds up said wand] Is this that wand? [She nods] Would you please tell the court from which witch or wizard you took this wand?

Mrs. Cattermole:
I didn't take it! I got it in Diagon Alley, at Ollivanders, when I was 11. It chose me!

Umbridge:
You're lying. Wands only choose witches, and you are not a witch.

Mrs. Cattermole:
But I am! [To Ron] Tell them, Reg! Tell them what I am! [Ron is silent] Reg, tell them what I am.

[Harry sees the locket, and his anger becomes too much. He withdraws his wand]

Umbridge:
What on earth are you doing, Albert?

Harry:
[As Runcorn] You're lying, Dolores... [Umbridge looks shocked, and Hermione tenses up] And one mustn't tell lies. Stupefy!

[He stuns Umbridge, knocking her out. Yaxley goes for his wand, but Ron gets there first and stuns him, while Hermione quickly scrabbles for the locket]

[Bellatrix holds Hermione and Griphook hostage]

Bellatrix:
[At Griphook] Consider yourself lucky, Goblin. [involving Hermione] The same won't be said for this one.

Ron Weasley:
Like hell! [charges upstairs to strike at Bellatrix] Expelliarmus!

The End Begins

Nowhere Is Safe

Part 1 Of The Epic Finale

The Hunt Begins

Ron:
Why spiders? Why couldn't it be follow the butterflies?

Lucius Malfoy:
Your scar is legend. As of course, is the wizard who gave it to you.

Harry:
Voldemort killed my parents, he was nothing more than a murderer.

Lucius Malfoy:
Hmm, you must be very brave to mention his name... or very foolish.

Ron:
They were starving him, Mum. There were bars on his window.

Mrs. Weasley:
You'd best hope I don't put bars on your window, Ronald Weasley.

Hermione:
Fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself.

Gilderoy Lockhart:
AMAZING. This is just like magic.

Ron:
Follow the spiders. Follow the spiders. If Hagrid ever gets out of Azkaban, I'll kill him.

Harry:
Not to be rude or anything, but this isn't a great time for me to have a house elf in my bedroom.

Dumbledore:
It is not our abilities that show what we truly are... it is our choices.

Moaning Myrtle:
Oh, Harry? If you die down there, you're welcome to share my toilet.

Harry:
Uh... thanks, Myrtle.

Oliver Wood:
I don't believe it! Where do you think you're going, Flint?

Marcus Flint:
Qudditch practice!

Oliver Wood:
But I booked the pitch for Gryffindor today.

Marcus Flint:
Easy, Wood. I've got a note.

Oliver Wood:
I, Professor Severus Snape do hereby give the Slytherin team permission to practice today, owing to the need to train their new Seeker. You've got a new seeker? Who?

Harry Potter:
Malfoy?

Draco Malfoy:
Thats right. And that's not all that's new this year.

Ron:
Those are Nimbus Two-Thousand and Ones! How'd you get those?

Marcus Flint:
A gift from Draco's father.

Draco Malfoy:
You see, Weasley, unlike some, my father can afford the best.

Hermione Granger:
At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in. They got in on pure talent.

Draco Malfoy:
No one asked your opinion you filthy little Mudblood!

Ron:
You'll pay for that one Malfoy! Eat slugs!

Colin Creevey:
Can you turn him around Harry?

Harry Potter:
No Colin! Get out of the way!

Neville Longbottom:
Why is it always me?

Uncle Vernon:
And Dudley, you will be?

Dudley Dursley:
I'll be waiting to open the door.

Uncle Vernon:
Excellent. And you?

Harry:
I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending I don't exist.

Hagrid:
Better out than in.

Hagrid:
And I'd just like to say that, if it hadn't been for you, Harry, and Ron, and Hermione of course, I would... I'd still be You-Know-Where. So I'd juste like to say: thanks.

Harry:
It's not Hogwarts without you, Hagrid.

Tom Marvolo Riddle:
Funny, the damage a silly little book can do, especially in the hands of a silly little girl.

Tom Marvolo Riddle:
How is it that a baby with no extraordinary magical talent was able to defeat the greatest wizard of all time? How did you escape with nothing but a scar, while Lord Voldemort's powers were destroyed?

Harry:
What do you care about Voldemort? Voldemort was after your time!

Tom Marvolo Riddle:
Voldemort is my past, present, and future.

Lucius Malfoy:
Let me see; red hair, vacant expressions, tatty second-hand books, you must be the Weasleys.

Arthur Weasley:
Now, Harry you must know all about Muggles, tell me, what exactly is the function of a rubber duck?

Ron:
Say it, I'm doomed.

Harry:
You're doomed.

Draco Malfoy:
Famous Harry Potter... Can't even go into a book shop without making the front page.

Draco Malfoy:
The last time The Chamber of secrets was opened a Mudblood died. So it's only a matter of time before one of them is killed this time. As for me... I hope it's Granger.

Ron:
Dad loves muggles, he thinks they're fascinating.

Hermione:
Even in the wizarding world, hearing voices isn't a good sign.

Moaning Myrtle:
I'm Moaning Myrtle. I wouldn't expect you to know me. Who would ever want to talk about ugly, miserable, moping, Moaning Myrtle? AHHH.

Hermione:
She's a little sensitive.

Harry:
You'd better clear out before my bones grow back, or else I might strangle you.

Dobby:
Dobby is used to death threats, he gets them five times a day at home.

Draco Malfoy:
Training for the ballet, Potter?

Hermione:
Look. Hagrid's our friend, why don't we just go and ask him about it?

Ron:
Oh, that'd be a cheerful visit. Ello Hagrid! Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?

Hagrid:
Mad and hairy? Yer wouldn't be talkin' about me, now would ya?

Ron:

Harry:
No.

Lucius Malfoy:
Let us hope that Mr. Potter will always be around to save the day.

Harry:
Don't worry. I will be.

Draco Malfoy:
Scared, Potter?

Harry:
You wish.

Filch:
Well, I'd take a good look lads. This night might be the last you spend in this castle. Oh dear, we are in trouble.

Hermione:
He called me a Mudblood.

Hagrid:
He did not.

Harry:
Ron, I should tell you, most Muggles aren't exactly accustomed to seeing a flying car.

Harry:
Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world.

Tom Marvolo Riddle:
Dumbledore has been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me.

The Sorting Hat:
Bee in your bonnet, Potter?

Harry:
I was just wondering, whether you put me into the right house?

The Sorting Hat:
Yes, you were particularly difficult to place, but I stand on what I said last year: You would have done well in Slytherin.

Harry:
You're wrong.

Harry:
But I haven't received any messages, from any of my friends. Not one, all summer.

Dudley Dursley:
Who'd want to be friends with you?

Ron:
Maybe we could trick them into telling.

Hermione:
Even THEY aren't that thick.

Harry:
There's no Hogwarts without you Hagrid.

Ginny:
Mummy, have you seen my jumper?

Mrs. Weasley:
Yes dear, it was on the cat.

Mrs. Weasley:
Now don't forget to speak very, very clearly.

Harry:
Diagonally.

Mrs. Weasley:
What did he say dear?

Arthur Weasley:
Diagonally.

Mrs. Weasley:
I thought he did.

Gilderoy Lockhart:
Harry, Harry, Harry. Can you possibly imagine a better way to serve detention, than by helping me answer my fan mail?

Harry:
Not really.

Gilderoy Lockhart:
Fame is a fickle friend Harry. Celebrity is as celebrity does. Remember that.

Professor Snape:
Weasley's wand causes devastation with the simplest spells. We'll be sending Potter to the hospital wing in a matchbox.

Harry:
Your bird, there was nothing I could do. He just caught fire.

Dumbledore:
Oh, and about time too. He's been looking dreadful for days. Pity you had to see him on a burning day.

Gilderoy Lockhart:
Books can be misleading.

Harry:
You wrote them.

Gilderoy Lockhart:
My dear boy, do use your common sense. My books wouldn't have sold half as well if people didn't think I'D done all those things.

Gilderoy Lockhart:
It's really quite filthy down here.

Hermoine:
Do you think he's all right?

Ron:
Who cares?

Tom Marvolo Riddle:
So this is what Dumbledore sends his great defender. A songbird and an old hat.

Tom Marvolo Riddle:
Let's match the powers of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin, against the famous Harry Potter.

Dobby:
Dobby is very sorry, Dobby had to iron his hands...

Gilderoy Lockhart:
Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission to start this little dueling club, to train you all up, in case you ever need to protect yourself, as I myself have done on countless occasions. For full details, see my published works.

Hermione:
Look at my face.

Ron:
Look at your tail.

Professor Snape:
If I might, Headmaster. Perhaps Potter and his friends were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. However, the circumstances are suspicious. I, for one, don't recall seeing Potter at dinner.

Gilderoy Lockhart:
That was my doing, Severus. You see, Harry was helping me answer my fan mail.

Gilderoy Lockhart:
Allow me to introduce you to your new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher; me. Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary member of the Dark Force Defense League, and five time winner of Witch Weekly's Most Charming Smile Award. But I don't talk about that; I didn't get rid of the Banden Banshee by smiling at him.

Lucius Malfoy:
What's the use of being a disgrace to the name of wizard, if they don't even pay you well for it?

Arthur Weasley:
We have a very different idea about what disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy.

Lucius Malfoy:
Clearly.

Lucius Malfoy:
Your scar is legend. As of course, is the wizard who gave it to you.

Ron:
Is there anything you CAN do?

Gilderoy Lockhart:
Yes, now that you mention it. I'm rather gifted with Memory Charms. Otherwise, all those wizards would have gone blabbing. I'd have never sold another book.

Tom Marvolo Riddle:
Haven't I told you? Killing Mudbloods doesn't matter to me any more. For many months now, my new target has been you.

Ron:
How thick can you get?

Professor Snape:
You were seen! By no less than seven Muggles! Do you have any idea how serious this is? You have risked the exposure of our world! Not to mention the damage you inflicted on Whomping Willow, that's been on these grounds since before you were born!

Ron:
Honestly, Professor Snape, I think it did more damage to us.

Professor Snape:
Silence! I assure you that were you in Slytherin and your fate rested with me, the both of you would be on the train home TONIGHT!

Ron:
Have you spoken to Hermione?

Harry:
She should be out of hospital in a few days... when she stops coughing up fur balls.

Ginny:
Leave him alone!

Draco Malfoy:
Look, Potter! You've got yourself a girlfriend.

Ron:
Enlighten me. Why are we brewing this potion in broad daylight, in the middle of a girls' lavatory? Don't you think we'll get caught?

Howler (Mrs. Weasley):
RONALD WEASLEY! HOW DARE YOU STEAL THAT CAR? I AM ABSOUTELY DISGUSTED! YOU'RE FATHER'S NOW FACING AN INQUIRY AT WORK, AND IT'S ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT! IF YOU PUT ANOTHER *TOE* OUT OF LINE, WE'LL BRING YOU STRAIGHT HOME! And Ginny, dear, congratulations on making it into Gryffindor. Your Father and I are so proud.

Lucius Malfoy:
Now, now Draco, play nicely.

Ron:
Let's think. Who do we know that thinks all Muggle-borns are scum.

Hermione:
If your'e talking about Malfoy...?

Ron:
Of course, Malfoy. You heard what he said You'll be next, Mudblood!

Oliver Wood:
All right, here's the plan. We play our game, Hufflepuff doesn't stand a chance. We're stronger, quicker and smarter.

Fred Weasley:
Not to mention they're terrified Harry will petrify them if they fly anywhere near him.

Oliver Wood:
That too.

Lucius Malfoy:
And you must be Miss Granger, I presume? Yes, Draco's told me all about you. And your parents... Muggles, aren't they?

Gilderoy Lockhart:
Hello. Who are you?

Ron:
Um... Ron Weasley.

Gilderoy Lockhart:
Really! And,uh, wh-who am I?

Ron:
Lockhart's memory charm backfired! He hasn't got a clue who he is!

Gilderoy Lockhart:
It's an odd sort of place, this, isn't it? Do you live here?

Ron:
No.

Gilderoy Lockhart:
Really?

Mrs Weasley in the form of a howler:
RONALD WEASLEY!!!! HOW DARE YOU STEAL THAT CAR!! I AM ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED!! YOUR FATHER'S NOW FACING AN INQUIRY AT WORK AND IT'S ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT!! IF YOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE, WE'LL BRING YOU STRAIGHT HOME!!

Oh and Ginny dear, congratulations on making Gryffindor, your father and I are so proud.

[Malfoy corners Harry, Hermione, and the Weasley children at Flourish & Blotts Bookstore after Harry unwillingly gets his picture taken with Lockhart.]

Draco Malfoy:
Bet you loved that, didn't you, Potter? Famous Harry Potter. Can't even go into a bookshop without making the front page.

Ginny Weasley:
Leave him alone.

Draco Malfoy:
[Smirking] Oh, look, Potter. You've got yourself a girlfriend.

Lucius Malfoy:
[Places the silver snake of his walking stick on Draco's shoulder] Now, now, Draco. Play nicely. [To Harry] Mr. Potter. Lucius Malfoy. We meet at last. Forgive me. [uses the silver snake to pull back Harry's bangs; sees his scar] Your scar is legend. As, of course, is the wizard who gave it to you.

Harry:
[firmly] Voldemort killed my parents. He was nothing more than a murderer.

Lucius Malfoy:
Hmm, you must be very brave to mention his name. Or very foolish.

Hermione:
[Indirectly quoting Dumbledore] Fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself.

Lucius Malfoy:
And you must be... Miss Granger. Yes, Draco's told me all about you... and your parents. [glances at the Grangers, who are speaking with Mr. Weasley] Muggles, aren't they? [Looks at Ron] Let me see. Red hair, vacant expressions... [Takes a book out of Ginny's cauldron] Tatty, secondhand book. [Smiles coldly] You must be the Weasleys.

Arthur Weasley:
[Arriving and attempting to ignore Mr. Malfoy] Children, it's mad in here. Let's go outside.

Lucius Malfoy:
Well, well, well. Weasley Senior.

Arthur Weasley:
Lucius.

Lucius Malfoy:
Busy time at the Ministry, Arthur. All those extra raids; I do hope they're paying you overtime. [Picks up one of Ginny's books] Though judging by the state of this, I'd say not. [Places the book back in Ginny's cauldron; another book has been slipped in with it, though only Harry notices] What's the use of being a disgrace to the name of wizard... if they don't even pay you well for it?

Arthur Weasley:
We have a very different idea about what disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy.

Lucius Malfoy:
Clearly. Associating with Muggles... And I thought your family could sink no lower. [Mr. Weasley glares at Mr Malfoy.] I'll see you at work.

Draco Malfoy:
See you at school.

[Lucius and Draco leave]

[Snape is reading a newspaper. On the front cover is the moving image of Ron's dad's car flying. The headline reads Flying Ford Anglia Mystifies Muggles]

Snape:
You were seen, by no less than seven Muggles! [He throws the newspaper down and glares at Harry and Ron] Do you have any idea how serious this is? You have risked the exposure of our world! Not to mention the damage you inflicted on a Whomping Willow that's been on these grounds since before you were born.

Ron:
Honestly, Professor Snape, I think it did more damage to us.

Snape:
Silence! I assure you that were you in Slytherin and your fate rested with me, the both of you would be on the train home, tonight! As it is...

Dumbledore:
They are not.

[Professor Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall enter the room.]

Harry:
Professor Dumbledore. Professor McGonagall.

Snape:
Headmaster... these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry. As such...

Dumbledore:
I am well aware of our bylaws, Severus, having written quite a few of them myself. However, as head of Gryffindor House, it is for Professor McGonagall to determine the appropriate action.

Ron:
We'll go and get our stuff, then.

McGonagall:
What are you talking about, Mr. Weasley?

Ron:
You're going to expel us, aren't you?

McGonagall:
Not today, Mr. Weasley. But I must impress on both of you the seriousness of what you have done. I will be writing to your families tonight, and you will both receive detentions.

Dean Thomas:
Ron? Is that your owl?

(Errol is flying towards the Gryffindor table with a letter; he crashes into a bowl of crisps, knocking them all over the table; Slytherins laugh as Ron nervously picks up the letter and Errol flies off)

Ron:
That bloody bird's a menace. [looks at the letter] Oh no!

Seamus Finnigan:
Look, everyone! Weasley's got himself a Howler!

Neville Longbottom:
Go on, Ron. I ignored one from my gran once... [looking uneasy] It was horrible!

(Ron nervously opens the Howler and Mrs. Weasley's voice echoes around the hall)

Mrs. Weasley via Howler:
RONALD WEASLEY!!! (The Howler forms itself into a ranting mouth) HOW DARE YOU STEAL THAT CAR!! I AM ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED! YOUR FATHER'S NOW FACING AN INQUIRY AT WORK, AND IT'S ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT!! IF YOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE, WE'LL BRING YOU STRAIGHT HOME!!! (The Howler turns to Ginny, who is eating her breakfast; its voice is now quiet and loving) Oh, and Ginny, dear, congratulations on making Gryffindor. Your father and I are so proud. (The Howler turns back to Ron and blows a raspberry at him, then tears itself to pieces)

Ron:
Those are Nimbus Two-Thousand and Ones! How did you get those?

Marcus Flint:
A gift from Draco's father.

Draco Malfoy:
You see, Weasley, unlike some, my father can afford the best.

Hermione:
At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in. They got in on pure talent.

Draco Malfoy:
[Annoyed] No one asked your opinion, you filthy little Mudblood.

[Hermione glares at him with a mixture of hate and hurt]

Ron:
You'll pay for that one, Malfoy! Eat slugs!

[Ron's spell backfires, blasting him off his feet. Harry and Hermione rush to his side.]

Hermione:
You okay, Ron? [Ron's face turns green] Say something!

[Ron opens his mouth as if to say something but instead regurgitates a slug.]

Colin Creevey:
[starts taking pictures of Ron] Wow! Can you turn him around, Harry?

Harry Potter:
No, Colin! Get out of the way. [he and Hermione help Ron to his feet] Let's take him to Hagrid. [Ron regurgitates another slug] He'll know what to do.

[The three of them rush off to Hagrid's while the Slytherins laugh at them.]

Minerva McGonagall:
Yes, Miss Granger?

Hermione Granger:
Professor, I was wondering if you'd tell us about the Chamber of Secrets.

Professor Minerva McGonagall:
[seeing everyone's faces] Very well. Well, you all knew, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago, by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. Now three of the founders co-existed quite harmoniously. One did not.

Ron Weasley:
[Sarcastic] Three guesses who.

Professor Minerva McGonagall:
Salazar Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts. He believed magical learning should be kept within all-magic families – in other words, pure-bloods. Unable to sway the others, he decided to leave the school. Now according to legend, Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in this castle, known as the Chamber of Secrets. Though shortly before departing, he sealed it... until that time when his own true heir returned to the school. The heir alone would be able to open the chamber and unleash the horror within, and by so doing, purge the school of all those who, in Slytherin's view, were unworthy to study magic.

Hermione Granger:
Muggle-borns.

Professor Minerva McGonagall:
Well, naturally the school has been searched many times. No such chamber has been found.

Hermione Granger:
Professor, what exactly does legend tell us lies within the Chamber?

Minerva McGonagall:
Well the Chamber is said to be home to something that only the Heir of Slytherin can control. it is said to be the home... of a monster.

[Hermione stares in shock, and Ron turns to Malfoy, who smirks.]

[At the Dueling Club]

Gilderoy Lockhart:
Let me introduce my assistant... Professor Snape. [Snape grudgingly walks up onto the platform] He has sportingly agreed to help me with a short demonstration. Now, I don't want any of you youngsters to worry. You'll still have your Potions Master when I'm through with him! Never fear. [Lockhart and Snape approach each other, bow to each other, walk a fair distance apart and ready their wands.] One, two, three...

Snape:
Expelliarmus!

[The spell blasts Lockhart across the room.]

Hermione:
[concerned] Do you think he's all right?

Ron:
[laughs] Who cares?

Gilderoy Lockhart:
An excellent idea to show them that, Professor Snape! But if you don't mind me saying, it was pretty obvious, uh, what you were about to do. And if I had wanted to stop you, it would have been only too easy–

Snape:
[losing patience] Perhaps it would be prudent to first teach the students to block unfriendly spells, Professor?

Gilderoy Lockhart:
An excellent suggestion, Professor Snape. Uh... Let's have a volunteer pair. Uh, Potter, Weasley. How about you?

[Harry walks to the platform steps]

Snape:
Weasley's wand causes devastation with the simplest spells. He'd be sending Potter to the hospital wing in a matchbox. Might I suggest someone from my own house? Malfoy, perhaps?

[Snape throws Malfoy onto the platform. He and Harry meet in the centre, and raise their wands as though they are fencing foils.]

Draco Malfoy:
Scared, Potter?

Harry:
You wish.

[Using a Polyjuice Potion, Harry and Ron are now disguised as Goyle and Crabbe as they leave the 2nd floor girls' bathroom]

Harry Potter [as Gregory Goyle]:
I think the Slytherin common room's this way.

Ron Weasley [as Vincent Crabbe]:
Okay.

[Percy Weasley spots them]

Percy Weasley:
Excuse me!

Ron Weasley [as Vincent Crabbe]:
What are you doing dow– [Harry hits him; Ron clears his throat and speaks more authoritatively] I mean, What are you doing down here?

Percy Weasley:
I happen to be a school Prefect. You, on the other hand, have no business wandering the corridors this time of night. What's your names again?

[Harry and Ron look at each other uncertainly]

Ron Weasley [as Vincent Crabbe]:
Uh...

Harry Potter [as Gregory Goyle]:
I'm...

Draco Malfoy:
[Rounding a corner] Crabbe! Goyle! Where have you two been? Pigging out in the Great Hall all this time? [looks oddly at Harry, who is still wearing his glasses Why are you wearing glasses?

Harry Potter [as Gregory Goyle]:
[Quickly removes his glasses] Um... Um... reading.

Draco Malfoy:
Reading? [Harry nods] I didn't know you could read. [Turns to Percy] And what are you doing down here, Weasley?

Percy Weasley:
Mind your attitude, Malfoy.

[Draco just smirks and walks off; Harry and Ron follow him to the Slytherin common room.]

Draco Malfoy:
You'd never know the Weasleys were purebloods, the way they behave. They're an embarrassment to the wizarding world – all of them! [Ron (disguised as Crabbe) clenches his fist angrily] What's wrong with you, Crabbe?

Ron:
[gets nudged by Harry (disguised as Goyle)] Ahem... stomachache.

Draco Malfoy:
You know, I'm surprised that the Daily Prophet hasn't done a report on all these attacks. I suppose Dumbledore is trying to hush it all up. Father always said Dumbledore was the worst thing that ever happened to this place.

Harry:
You're wrong!

Draco Malfoy:
[sternly] What? You think there's someone here who's worse than Dumbledore? [Goyle doesn't reply] Well? Do you?

Harry:
[gulps] Harry Potter?

[Draco sits back on the couch, considering this]

Draco Malfoy:
Good one, Goyle. You're absolutely right. Saint Potter. And people actually think that he's the Heir of Slytherin?

Harry:
Well, then, you must have some idea who's behind it all.

Draco Malfoy:
You know I don't, Goyle. I told you yesterday. How many times do I have to tell you? [picks up the package and shakes it] Is this yours? [Harry shakes his head] But, my father did say this: It's been 50 years since the Chamber was opened. He wouldn't tell me who opened it, only they were expelled. The last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died. So, it's only a matter of time before one of them is killed this time. As for me... I hope it's Granger. [Ron tries to rush at him, but Harry stops him] What's the matter with you two? You're acting very... odd.

Harry:
It's his... stomachache.

[Harry and Ron find Myrtle crying after flooding the girls' bathroom]

Myrtle:
Come to throw something else at me?

Harry:
Why would I throw something at you?

Myrtle:
Don't ask me. Here I am, minding my own business, and someone thinks it's funny to throw a book at me.

Ron:
But it can't hurt if someone throws something at you. I mean, it'd just go right through you.

Myrtle:
[flies down at him furiously] SURE! Let's all throw books at Myrtle, because she can't feel it! Ten points if you get it through her stomach! [punches through Ron's] Fifty points if it goes through her HEAD! [punches through his]

Harry:
But who threw it at you, anyway?

Myrtle:
[more calmly] I don't know, I didn't see them. I was just sitting in the U-bend, thinking about death, [sighs] and it fell through the top of my head. Mm-hmm! [nods and floats away, sobbing]

Harry:
It was Hagrid. Hagrid opened the Chamber if Secrets 50 years ago.

Hermoine:
It can't be Hagrid. It just can't be.

Ron:
We don't even know this Tom Riddle. He sounds like a dirty rotten snitch to me.

Harry:
The monster had killed somebody, Ron. What would any of us have done?

Hermione:
Look, Hagrid is our friend, so why don't we just go and ask him?

Ron:
[Sarcastically] That will be a cheerful visit. Hello, Hagrid. Tell us, have you sent anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?

Hagrid:
[Appears from behind] Mad and hairy? Yer wouldn't be talkin' about me, now are ya?

Harry, Ron, and Hermione:
No!

'Harry:
[notices the canister of liquid Hagrid is carrying] What's that you've got, Hagrid?

Hagrid:
Oh, it's, uh, flesh-eating slug repellent. For the mandrakes, you know. Now, according to Professor Sprout, they’ve still got a bit of growing to do. But, once their acne’s been cleared up, we’ll be able to chop them and stew them, and then we’ll get those people down at the hospital un-petrified. In the meantime, though, you three... had best be looking after yourselves, all right? [turns and walks back where he came from; Neville starts running from in the direction Hagrid’s going] Hello, Neville.

Neville:
Harry, I don't know who did it, but you'd better come! Come on!

(Hagrid is being arrested)

Hagrid:
[knowing that Harry and Ron are inside the hut, in the invisibility cloak] If... um... If anybody was looking for some stuff, then all they'd have to do would be to follow the spiders. Yep. That would leave them right. That's all I have to say. Oh, and someone will need to feed Fang while I'm away.

Cornelius Fudge:
[to Fang] Good boy. [He, Hagrid and Lucius Malfoy leave. Harry and Ron remove the cloak of invisibility]

Ron:
Hagrid's right. With Dumbledore gone, there'll be an attack a day.

Harry:
Look. [sees a trail of spiders on Hagrid's window] Come on. [grabs a lantern] Come on, Fang. Come on.

Ron:
What?

Harry:
You heard what Hagrid said. Follow the spiders.

Ron:
They're heading to the Dark Forest! [Harry ignores him] Why spiders?! Why couldn't be follow the butterflies?! [follows Harry out the door]

Aragog:
Who is it?

Harry:
[to a terrified Ron] Don't panic.

Aragog:
Hagrid? Is that you?

Harry:
We're friends of Hagrid. [A colossal, tarantula-like spider emerges] You... You're Aragog, aren't you?

Aragog:
Yes. Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before.

Harry:
Well, he's in trouble. Up at the school, there have been attacks. They think it's Hagrid. They think he opened the Chamber of Secrets, like before.

Aragog:
That's a lie! Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets.

Harry:
Then you're not the monster?

Aragog:
No. The monster was born in the castle. I came to Hagrid from a distant land, in the pocket of a traveler.

Ron:
[noticing other giant spiders around them; whimpering] Harry...

Harry:
Shush. [to Aragog] Well, if you're not the monster, then what did kill that girl 50 years ago?

Aragog:
We do not speak of it! It is an ancient creature that we spiders fear above all others.

Harry:
But have you seen it?

Aragog:
I never saw any part of the castle but the box in which Hagrid kept me. The girl was discovered in a bathroom. When I was accused, Hagrid brought me here.

Ron:
[sounding like he's about to cry] Harry?

Harry:
[irritated] What?! [Ron points upwards in terror – giant spiders descend and surround them] [to Aragog] Well... thank you. We'll just go.

Aragog:
Go? I think not. My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid on my command, but I cannot deny them fresh meat when it wanders so willingly into our midst. Goodbye, friends of Hagrid.

Ron:
[to Harry] Can we panic now? [the spiders move in for the attack] Know any spells?

Harry:
One – but it's not powerful enough for all of them.

Ron:
Where's Hermione when you need her?

Harry:
[reads the paper from the book taken by Hermione] Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land, none is more deadly than the basilisk. Capable of living for hundreds of years, instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent's eye. Spiders flee before it. Ron, this is it. The monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a basilisk. That's why I can hear it speak. It's a snake.

Ron:
But if it kills by looking people in the eye, why is it no one's dead?

Harry:
Because no one did look it in the eye. Not directly, at least. Colin saw it through his camera. Justin– Justin must have seen the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick. Nick got the full blast of it. But he's a ghost, he couldn't die again. And Hermione had the mirror. I bet you she was using it to look around corners in case it came along.

Ron:
And Mrs. Norris? I'm pretty sure she didn't have a camera or a mirror, Harry.

Harry:
The water. There was water on the floor that night. She only saw the basilisk's reflection. [reads again] Spiders flee before it. It all fits!

Ron:
But how's a basilisk been getting around? A dirty, great snake. Someone would have seen it.

Harry:
Hermione's answered that too.

[Harry and Ron read the last word on paper]

Ron:
Pipes? It's using the plumbing!

Harry:
Remember what Aragog said about that girl 50 years ago? She died in a bathroom? What if she never left?

Ron:
Moaning Myrtle.

Minerva McGonagall:
As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin has left another message. Our worst fear has been realized. A student has been taken by the monster into the Chamber itself! The students must be sent home. I'm afraid this is the end of Hogwarts.

Lockhart:
[entering] So sorry. Dozed off. What have I missed?

Snape:
A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. Your moment has come at last.

Lockhart:
My moment?

Snape:
Weren't you saying just last night that you've known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?

[Lockhart doesn't answer]

Minerva McGonagall:
That's settled. We'll leave you to deal with the monster, Gilderoy. Your skills, after all, are legend.

Lockhart:
Very well. I'll just be in my office getting... getting ready.

Poppy Pomfrey:
Who is it that the monster's taken, Minerva?

Minerva McGonagall:
Ginny Weasley.

[Harry and Ron are shocked and read the message written in blood on the wall]

Ron:
[reads it] Her skeleton will lie in the Chamber forever. Ginny...

[Harry and Ron catch Lockhart packing some trunks for a hasty retreat]

Harry:
Are you going somewhere?

Lockhart:
[nervously] Um, well, yes. Urgent call, unavoidable. Got to go...

Ron:
What about my sister?!

Lockhart:
Well, as to that - most unfortunate. No one regrets more than I...

Ron:
You're the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher! You can't go now!

Lockhart:
I must say, when I took the job, nothing in the job description--

Harry:
You're running away, after all that stuff you did in your books?!

Lockhart:
Books can be misleading.

Harry:
You wrote them!

Lockhart:
My dear boy, do use your common sense! My books wouldn't have sold half as well if people didn't think I'd done all those things!

Harry:
[realizing, outraged] You're a FRAUD. You've just been taking credit for what other wizards have done!

Ron:
Is there anything you can do?

Lockhart:
Yes, now you mention it. I'm rather gifted with Memory Charms. Otherwise, you see, all those wizards would have gone blabbing, and I'd never have sold another book. And now, I'm afraid I'll have to do the same to you--

[He grabs his wand, only to have Harry and Ron already aiming theirs at him]

Harry:
Don't even think about it.

Harry:
It's a snake skin.

Ron:
Bloody hell. Whoever shed this must be 60 feet long, or more. [Lockhart pretends to pass out. Ron notices.] Heart of a lion, this one.

Lockhart:
[jumps up and grabs Ron's wand; aims the wand at Harry, then at Ron, then at Harry again] The adventure ends here, boys. But don't fret. [Points it at Ron] The world will know our story. How I was too late to save the girl. How you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body. So... [Aims it at Harry] You first, Mr. Potter. Say goodbye... to your memories. Obliviate!

[Lockhart is blasted into the ceiling by the spell, having used Ron's broken wand for the job, causing a cave-in that separates Harry from him and Ron.]

Ron:
Harry?! Harry!

Harry:
Ron! Ron, are you okay?

Ron:
I'm fine.

Gilderoy Lockhart:
[sits up and grins at Ron] Hello. Who are you?

Ron:
Uh, Ron Weasley.

Gilderoy Lockhart:
Really? And, um, who-who am I?

Ron:
[to Harry] Lockhart's Memory Charm backfired! He hasn't got a clue who he is!

Gilderoy Lockhart:
[picks up a rock] It's an odd sort of place, isn't it? Do you live here?

Ron:
[takes the rock from Lockhart] No.

Gilderoy Lockhart:
Really?

[Ron hits Lockhart on the head with the rock, knocking him out.]

Ron:
What do I do now?

Harry:
You wait here and try to shift some of this rock so we can get back through. I'll go on and find Ginny.

Ron:
Okay.

[Harry has just entered the Chamber of Secrets. He see Ginny Weasley lying motionless at the end of the chamber.]

Harry:
Ginny. [Runs to her] Ginny. Ginny. Please don't be dead. Wake up. Wake up!

Tom Riddle:
[suddenly appears out of nowhere] She won't wake.

Harry:
Tom? Tom Riddle? What do you mean she won't wake? She's not...?

Tom Riddle:
She's still alive, but only just.

Harry:
Are you a ghost?

Tom Riddle:
A memory, preserved in a diary for fifty years.

Harry:
[touches her hand] She's cold as ice. Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up. [Tom picks up Harry's wand] You've got to help me, Tom. There's a basilisk--

Tom Riddle:
It won't come until it's called.

Harry:
Give me my wand, Tom.

Tom Riddle:
You won't be needing it.

Harry:
Listen, we've got to go, we've got to save her!

Tom Riddle:
I'm afraid I can't do that. You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker... I grow stronger. Yes, Harry. It was Ginny Weasley who opened the Chamber of Secrets.

Harry:
No. She couldn't. I mean, she wouldn't!

Tom Riddle:
It was Ginny who set the basilisk on the mudbloods and Filch's cat. [flashback of Ginny watching the Chamber's entrance in the toilets open] It was Ginny who wrote the threatening messages on the walls. [flashback of Ginny writing the massages]

Harry:
But why?

Tom Riddle:
Because I told her to. You'll find I can be very... persuasive. Not that she knew what she was doing. She was in, shall we say, a kind of trance. Still, the power of the diary began to scare her, and she tried to dispose of it in the girl's bathroom. [flashback of Ginny running into a toilet cubicle and throwing the diary into the toilet] And then who should find it... but you? The very person I was most anxious to meet.

Harry:
And why did you want to meet me?

Tom Riddle:
I knew I had to talk to you, meet you if I could. So I decided to show you my capture of that brainless oaf, Hagrid, to gain your trust.

Harry:
[angrily] Hagrid's my friend! And you framed him, didn't you?

Tom Riddle:
It was my word against Hagrid's. Only Dumbledore seemed to think he was innocent.

Harry:
[smiling] I bet Dumbledore saw right through you.

Tom Riddle:
He certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after that. I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the Chamber again while I was still at school, so I decided to leave behind a diary – preserving my sixteen year-old self in its pages so that one day, I would be able to lead another to finish Salazar Slytherin's noble work.

Harry:
Well, you haven't finished it this time. In a few hours, the mandrake draught will be ready and everyone who was petrified will be all right again.

Tom Riddle:
Haven't I told you? Killing mudbloods doesn't matter to me anymore. For many months now, my new target... has been you. How is it that a baby with no extraordinary magical talent was able to defeat the greatest wizard of all time? How did you escape, with nothing but a scar, while Lord Voldemort's powers were destroyed?

Harry:
Why do you care how I escaped? Voldemort was after your time.

Tom Riddle:
Voldemort... is my past, present, and future. [uses Harry's wand to write his full name in midair: TOM MARVOLO RIDDLE. He slashes the wand and the letters rearrange to become I AM LORD VOLDEMORT, before they fade]

Harry:
[stunned] You. You're the heir of Slytherin. You're Voldemort.

Tom Riddle:
Surely, you didn't think I was going to keep my filthy Muggle father's name? No. I fashioned myself a new name. A name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak, when I became the greatest sorcerer in the world!

Harry:
Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world!

Tom Riddle:
Dumbledore's been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me!

Harry:
He'll never be gone! Not as long as those who remain are loyal to him! [Fawkes suddenly enters the chamber] Fawkes? [Fawkes drops the Sorting Hat to Harry and leaves]

Tom Riddle:
So... this is what Dumbledore sends his great defender: a songbird and an old hat. [turns to the statue of Salazar Slytherin and speaks in Parseltongue] Speak to me, Slytherin, greatest of the Hogwarts Four. [The statue's mouth begins to open] Let's match the power of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Slytherin, against the famous Harry Potter. [The basilisk's snout emerges from the mouth; Harry turns and runs as the creature fully emerges] [in Parseltongue] Kill him! [to Harry] Parseltongue won't save you now, Potter! It only obeys me!

Lucius Malfoy:
The culprit has been identified, I presume?

Albus Dumbledore:
Oh, yes.

Lucius Malfoy:
And...? Who was it?

Albus Dumbledore:
[after exchanging a look with Harry] Voldemort.

Lucius Malfoy:
Ah.

Albus Dumbledore:
Only this time, he chose to act through somebody else... by means of this. [He reveals Tom Riddle's diary – which Lucius had slipped into Ginny's cauldron. Dobby tugs Harry's sleeve uneasily and looks over at Lucius.]

Lucius:
I see.

Dumbledore:
Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter discovered it. One hopes that no more of Voldemort's old school things should find their way into innocent hands. The consequences for the one responsible would be... severe.

Lucius Malfoy:
Well... let us hope that Mr. Potter will always be around to save the day.

Harry:
Don't worry. I will be.

Harry:
Mr. Malfoy. Mr. Malfoy! [Lucius turns around] I have something of yours. [Hands him the diary]

Lucius Malfoy:
Mine? I don't know what you're talking about.

Harry:
Oh, I think you do, sir. I think you slipped the diary into Ginny Weasley's cauldron, that day at Diagon Alley.

Lucius Malfoy:
You do, do you? [Hands the diary to Dobby] Well...[Whispers] why don't you prove it? [Harry doesn't answer because he just did] Come, Dobby.

Harry:
[Whispers to Dobby] Open it.

[Dobby opens Tom Riddle's Diary to find a folded sock inside.]

Lucius Malfoy:
Dobby?

Dobby:
Master has given Dobby a sock.

Lucius Malfoy:
What? [Turns around] I didn't give–

Dobby:
[Holding the sock in delight] Master has presented Dobby with clothes! Dobby is free!

[Harry pulls up his pant leg, revealing it was his sock]

Lucius Malfoy:
[Furious] You lost me my SERVANT! [Pulls his wand from his cane and aims it directly at Harry. Dobby then stands in his way]

Dobby:
You shall not harm Harry Potter!

Lucius Malfoy:
[About to curse Harry] Avada– [Dobby blasts him backwards across the hall; Lucius stands] Your parents were meddlesome fools, too. Mark my words, Potter. One day soon, you're going to meet the same, sticky end. [Leaves]

Dobby:
Harry Potter freed Dobby. How can Dobby ever repay him?

Harry:
Just promise me something.

Dobby:
Anything, sir.

Harry:
Never try to save my life again.

Hermione:
He called me a Mudblood.

Hagrid:
[Stunned] He did not.

Harry:
What's a Mudblood?

Hermione:
It means dirty blood. Mudblood's a really foul name for someone who is Muggle-born. Someone with non-magic parents. Someone like me. It's not a term one usually hears in civilized conversation.

[Harry, Ron, and Hermione are walking along a hallway.]

Ron:
Do you think it's true? Do you think there really is a Chamber of Secrets?

Hermione':
Yes. Couldn't you tell? McGonagall's worried. All the teachers are.

Harry:
But if there really is a Chamber of Secrets, a-and it really has been opened, then that means–

Hermione:
The heir of Slytherin has returned to Hogwarts. The question is: who is it?

[As Harry, Ron, and Hermione are talking, Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle pass by them.]

Ron:
Let's think, who do we know who thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?

Hermione:
If you're talking about Malfoy–

Ron:
Of course, you heard him. You'll be next, Mudbloods.

Hermione:
I heard him. But Malfoy, the heir of Slytherin?

Harry:
Maybe Ron's right, Hermione. I mean, look at his family. The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin for centuries.

Ron:
Crabbe and Goyle must know. Maybe we could trick them into telling.

Hermione:
Even they aren't that thick. But there might be another way.

[Harry, Ron, and Hermione stop walking.]

Hermione:
Mind you, it would be difficult. Not to mention we'd be breaking about fifty school rules. And it'll be dangerous. Very dangerous.

[In the library, Hermione takes a book about Polyjuice Potion from a shelf and goes over to Harry and Ron, who are trying to find which books they should take from a shelf.]

Hermione:
Here it is. The Polyjuice Potion. [Reads from the book] Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion allows the drinker to transform himself temporarily into the physical form of another.

Ron:
You mean, if Harry and I drink that stuff, we'll turn into Crabbe and Goyle?

Hermione:
Yes.

Ron:
Wicked! Malfoy will tell us anything.

Hermione:
Exactly. But it's tricky. I've never seen a more complicated potion.

Harry:
Well, how long will it take to make?

Hermione:
A month.

Harry:
A month? But Hermione, if Malfoy is the heir of Slytherin, he could attack half the Muggle-borns in the school by then.

Hermione:
I know. But it's the only plan we've got.

[Malfoy starts groaning in pain while lying on a bed. Crabbe and Goyle sit on the bed. Madame Pomfrey comes into the hospital wing holding a Skele-Gro bottle.]

Madame Pomfrey:
Mr. Malfoy, stop making such a fuss! You can go!

[Madame Pomfrey approaches a group of students, who are gathering around Harry, who is lying on another bed.]

Madame Pomfrey:
[Motions for some of the students to move out of the way] Out of my way! Out of my way!

[Some of the students move out of the way for Madame Pomfrey to approach a table and put the Skele-Gro bottle down.]

Madame Pomfrey:
You should've been brought straight to me. I can mend bones in a heartbeat, but growing them back–

Hermoine:
You will be able to, won't you?

Madame Pomfrey:
Oh, I'll be able to, certainly. But it'll be painful.

[Madame Pomfrey pours Skele-Gro into a glass.]

Madame Pomfrey:
You're in for a rough night, Potter. Regrowing bones is a nasty business.

[Madame Pomfrey gives the glass to Harry. Harry takes the glass and drinks from it, but spits the Skele-Gro out in disgust.]

Madame Pomfrey:
Well, what do you expect? Pumpkin juice?

Dobby:
[Hops on the bed] Listen. Listen! Terrible things are about to happen at Hogwarts. Harry Potter must not stay here, now that history is to repeat itself.

Harry:
Repeat itself? You mean this has happened before?

Dobby:
[Gasps and covers his mouth] I shouldn't have said that! [Picks up the Skele-Gro bottle and hits himself on the head with it repeatedly] Bad Dobby! Bad!

Harry:
Stop it, Dobby! [Takes the bottle off of Dobby's hands and violently grabs him by the mark collar] Tell me Dobby. When did this happen before? Who's doing it now?

Dobby:
Dobby cannot say, sir. Dobby only wants Harry Potter to be safe.

Harry:
No, Dobby. Tell me. Who is it?

[Dobby hears someone coming. He snaps his fingers and vanishes into thin air.]

[Harry runs into the Gryffindor common room. Ron and Hermione follow him.]

Ron:
[Stops Harry] You're a Parselmouth? Why didn't you tell us?

Harry:
[Confused] I'm a what?

Hermione:
You can talk to snakes.

Harry:
I know. I mean, I accidentally set a python on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once. Once. But so what? I bet loads of people here can do it.

Hermione:
No, they can't. It's not a very common gift, Harry. This is bad.

Harry:
What's bad? If I hadn't told that snake not to attack Justin–

Ron:
That's what you said to it!

Harry:
You were there. You heard me.

Ron:
I heard you speaking Parseltongue. Snake language.

Harry:
[Surprised] I spoke a different language?

[Ron nods.]

Harry:
But I didn't realize– How can I speak a language without knowing I can?

Hermione:
I don't know, Harry, but it sounded like you were egging the snake on or something. Harry, listen to me. There's a reason the symbol of Slytherin house is a serpent. Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth. He could talk to snakes too.

Ron:
Exactly. Now the whole school's gonna think you're his great-great-great grandson or something.

Harry:
But I'm not! I can't be.

Hermione:
He lived a thousand years ago. For all we know, you could be.

[In the Gryffindor common room, the Gryffindor students are talking with each other when McGonagall walks in holding a scroll.]

McGonagall:
Could I have your attention, please? Because of recent events, these new rules will be put into effect immediately. [Reads the scroll] All students will return to their house common rooms by 6:00 every evening. All students will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher. No exceptions. I should tell you this. Unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught, it is likely the school will be closed.

[McGonagall walks out. The students resume talking with each other. Harry turns to Ron.]

Harry:
We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron. I can't believe it's him. But if he did set the monster loose last time, he'll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets. And that's a start.

Ron:
But you heard McGonagall. We're not allowed to leave the tower except for class.

Harry:
I think it's time to get my dad's old cloak out again.

[Hagrid is making tea when he hears a knock on his door.]

Hagrid:
[Points a crossbow] Who's there? [Kicks the door open and points the crossbow outside] Hello? Hello?

[Harry and Ron remove the Invisibility Cloak.]

Harry:
What's that for?

Hagrid:
Oh, nothing. I was expecting. It doesn't matter. Come on in. I just made a pot of tea.

[Hagrid pours tea in a cup.]

Harry:
Hagrid, are you okay?

Hagrid:
I'm fine. I'm alright.

Harry:
Did you hear about Hermione?

Hagrid:
Oh, yeah. I heard about that, alright.

Harry:
Look, we have to ask you something.

[Harry, Ron, and Hagrid hear a knock on the door.]

Hagrid:
Quick, under the cloak. Don't say a word and be quiet, both of you.

[Harry and Ron go over to a corner. Ron throws the cloak over himself and Harry.]

Harry Potter:
We know one thing. Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets. He was innocent.

Ron Weasley:
[When seeing the Gryffindor team and the Slytherin team confronting each other] Uh-oh. I smell trouble.

Ron Weasley:
That would be a cheerful visit. Hello, Hagrid. Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?

Hermione Granger:
The Chamber of Secrets has been opened, Enemies of the heir, beware. It's written in blood.

Hermione Granger:
[About Myrtle] She's a little sensitive.

Albus Dumbledore:
In light of recent events, as a school treat– all exams have been cancelled!

Ginny Weasley:
Harry, it was me. But I swear. I didn't mean to. Riddle made me, and– [Looks at Harry's wound from the snake he killed] Harry, you're hurt.

Tom Marvolo Riddle:
Yes, Potter, the process is nearly complete. In a few minutes, Ginny Weasley will be dead. And I will cease to be a memory. Lord Voldemort will return– very– much– alive.

Dr. Ian Malcolm:
The lack of humility before nature that's being displayed here, uh... staggers me.

Lex:
He left us! He left us!

Dr. Alan Grant:
But that's NOT what I'M gonna do.

Dr. Ellie Sattler:
I was overwhelmed by the power of this place; but I made a mistake, too. I didn't have enough respect for that power and it's out now. The only thing that matters now are the people we love: Alan and Lex and Tim. John, they're out there where people are dying.

Dr. Ian Malcolm:
She's... ah... tenacious.

Dr. Alan Grant:
You have no idea.

Dr. Alan Grant:
You married?

Dr. Ian Malcolm:
Occasionally.

Dr. Alan Grant:
Oh my God. Do you know what this is? This is a dinosaur egg. The dinosaurs are breeding.

Lex:
I'm a hacker!

Tim:
That's what I said: you're a nerd.

Lex:
I am not a computer nerd. I prefer to be called a hacker!

Dr. Ellie Sattler:
We can make it if we run.

Muldoon:
No, we can't.

Dr. Ellie Sattler:
Why not?

Muldoon:
Because we are being hunted.

Dr. Ellie Sattler:
Oh God.

Henry Wu:
You're implying that a group composed entirely of female animals will... breed?

Dr. Ian Malcolm:
No, I'm simply saying that life, uh... finds a way.

Dr. Alan Grant:
Well where does he think he's going?

Dr. Ian Malcolm:
When you gotta go, you gotta go.

John Hammond:
Dr. Grant, my dear Dr. Sattler. Welcome to Jurassic Park

Dr. Ian Malcolm:
I'm always on the lookout for another ex-Mrs. Malcolm.

John Hammond:
We've made living biological attractions so astounding that they'll capture the imagination of the entire planet.

John Hammond:
I spared no expenses.

Dr. Alan Grant:
It looks like we're out of a job.

Dr. Ian Malcolm:
Don't you mean extinct?

Dr. Ian Malcolm:
Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.

John Hammond:
All major theme parks have had delays. When they opened Disneyland in 1956, nothing worked, nothing.

Dr. Ian Malcolm:
But, John. But if the Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates don't eat the tourists.

Dr. Ian Malcolm:
I'll tell you the problem with the scientific power that you're using here: it didn't require any discipline to attain it. You read what others had done and you took the next step. You didn't earn the knowledge for yourselves, so you don't take any responsibility for it. You stood on the shoulders of geniuses to accomplish something as fast as you could and before you even knew what you had you patented it and packaged it and slapped it on a plastic lunchbox, and now you're selling it, you want to sell it!

Dr. Ian Malcolm:
That is one big pile of sh*t.

Dr. Ian Malcolm:
You will remember to wash your hands before you eat anything?

Dr. Ian Malcolm:
Anybody hear that? It's an... It's an impact tremor, that's what it is... I'm fairly alarmed here.

Dr. Ian Malcolm:
Must go faster.

Dr. Ian Malcolm:
Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend.

Lex:
It's a UNIX system! I know this!

Dr. Ian Malcolm:
God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates man. Man destroys God. Man creates dinosaurs...

Dr. Ellie Sattler:
Dinosaurs eat man. Woman inherits the earth...

Dr. Ian Malcolm:
God help us; we're in the hands of engineers.

Dr. Ian Malcolm:
You think they'll have that on the tour?

Dr. Ian Malcolm:
Boy, do I hate being right all the time!

Dr. Alan Grant:
Mr. Hammond, after careful consideration, I've decided *not* to endorse your park.

John Hammond:
So have I.

Dr. Ian Malcolm:
There. Look at this. See? See? I'm right again. Nobody could've predicted that Dr. Grant would suddenly, suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle.

Dr. Ellie Sattler:
Alan? Alan!

Dr. Ian Malcolm:
There's, another example. See, here I'm now by myself, uh, er, talking to myself. That's, that's chaos theory.

Dr. Ellie Sattler:
Should we chance moving him?

Dr. Ian Malcolm:
Please, chance it.

John Hammond:
There is no doubt that our attractions will drive children out of their minds.

Dr. Alan Grant:
What are those?

Dr. Ellie Sattler:
Small versions of adults, honey.

Dennis Nedry:
Ah ah ah, you didn't say the magic word.

Ray Arnold:
*Please*! Goddammit!

Dr. Alan Grant:
Hey! We were saving that!

John Hammond:
For today, I guarantee it.

Dr. Alan Grant:
Babies smell!

Dr. Alan Grant:
Try to imagine yourself in the Cretaceous Period. You get your first look at this six foot turkey as you enter a clearing. He moves like a bird, lightly, bobbing his head. And you keep still because you think that maybe his visual acuity is based on movement like T-Rex, he'll lose you if you don't move. But no, not Velociraptor. You stare at him, and he just stares right back. And that's when the attack comes. Not from the front, but from the side, from the other two 'raptors you didn't even know were there. Because Velociraptor's a pack hunter, you see, he uses coordinated attack patterns and he is out in force today. And he slashes at you with this... a six-inch retractable claw, like a razor, on the the middle toe. He doesn't bother to bite your jugular like a lion, say... no no. He slashes at you here... or here... or maybe across the belly, spilling your intestines. The point is... you are alive when they start to eat you. So you know... try to show a little respect.

Muldoon:
They should all be destroyed.

Muldoon:
Shoot her! Shoot her!

Muldoon:
Clever girl.

Ray Arnold:
Hold on to your butts.

Juanito Rostagno:
Hold on to your butts.

Lex:
He's gonna eat the goat?

Tim:
Excellent!

Lew Dodgson:
What's the matter, kid? Ever have lamb chops?

Lex:
I happen to be a vegetarian.

Tim:
What do you call a blind dinosaur?

Dr. Alan Grant:
I don't know.

Tim:
A Do-you-think-he-saurus.

Dr. Alan Grant:
Ha ha. Good one.

Tim:
What do you call a blind dinosaur's dog?

Dr. Alan Grant:
You got me.

Tim:
A Do-you-think-he-saurus Rex.

Muldoon:
What about the lysine contingency? We could put that into effect!

Dr. Ellie Sattler:
What's that?

John Hammond:
It is absolutely out of the question.

Ray Arnold:
The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the spread of the animals is case they ever got off the island, but we could use it now. Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism. Animals can't manufacture the amino acid lysine. Unless they're continually supplied with lysine by us, they'll slip into a coma and die.

Dr. Ellie Sattler:
How could we cut off the lysine?

Ray Arnold:
No real trick to it. Just stop running the program, leaving them unattended.

Dr. Ian Malcolm:
How long before they become comatose?

Ray Arnold:
It would be totally painless - they'd just slip into unconsciousness and die.

Dr. Ian Malcolm:
How long until they slip into unconsciousness?

Dr. Ellie Sattler:
Hmm... seven days, more or less.

Dr. Ellie Sattler:
Seven days? Seven days? Oh, that's great. Clever!

Dr. Ian Malcolm:
That'll be a first - man and dinosaur all die together. John's plan.

John Hammond:
People are dying! Mr. Arnold, will you please shut down the system.

Ray Arnold:
OK, but... you asked for it. Hold on to your butts!

Muldoon:
What about the lysine contingency? We could put that into effect!

Dr. Ellie Sattler:
What's that?

John Hammond:

John Hammond:

Ray Arnold:
OK, but... you asked for it. Hold on to your butts!

Dr. Alan Grant:
What did I touch?

Dr. Ian Malcolm:
You didn't touch anything. We stopped.

Donald Gennaro:
Hey, where'd you find that?

Tim:
In a box under my seat.

Donald Gennaro:
Are they heavy?

Tim:
Yeah.

Donald Gennaro:
Then they're expensive, put 'em back.

Dr. Ian Malcolm:
You did it. You crazy son of a b*tch you did it.

Dr. Ian Malcolm:
I love kids! Anything at all *can* and *does* happen... Same with wives, for that matter...

John Hammond:
Condors! Condors are on the verge of extinction. If I was to create a flock of condors on this island, you wouldn't have anything to say!

Dr. Ian Malcolm:
No hold on, this is not some species that was obliterated by deforestation, or the building of a damn. Dinosaurs, uh, *had* their shot, and nature *selected* them for extinction!

Dr. Ellie Sattler:
Doctor Grant's not machine compatible.

John Hammond:
I don't blame people for their mistakes, but I do ask that they pay for them.

Dennis Nedry:
Thanks, Dad.

Tim:
I hate trees.

Lex:
They don't bother me.

Tim:
Ya, well, you weren't in the last one.

Dr. Ian Malcolm:
What is so great about discovery? It is a violent, penetrative act that scars what it explores. What you call discovery, I call the rape of the natural world.

Dr. Ian Malcolm:
What've they got in there, King Kong?

Dr. Alan Grant:
...Kids. You want to have one of those?

Dr. Ellie Sattler:
I don't want *that* kid.

John Hammond:
Nedry, our lives are in you hands, and you've got Butterfingers?

Dr. Alan Grant:
Uh... it's... it's a dinosaur!

Dennis Nedry:
Don't get cheap on me, Dodgson. That was Hammond's mistake.

Dr. Alan Grant:
They're moving in herds. They do move in herds.

Alan Grant:
[entering his trailer to find a man rummaging through his refrigerator] What the hell do you think you're doing in here? [The man turns holding a champagne bottle and popping the cork] Hey, we were saving that!

John Hammond:
[smiling] For today. I guarantee it.

Alan Grant:
[Angrily approaches Hammond pointing at him] Who is God's name do you think you are?

John Hammond:
John Hammond, [shakes Alan Grant's finger before blowing the dust off his hands] and I'm delighted to to meet you finally in person, Dr. Grant!

Alan Grant:
[awed] Mr Hammond…

John Hammond:
Well, I can see that my, uh fifty - thousand a year has been well spent.

Ellie Sattler:
[Entering the trailer angrily] OK, who's the jerk!

Alan Grant:
Uh, this is our paleobotanist, Dr…

Ellie Sattler:
Sattler.

Alan Grant:
Sattler…Ellie this is, uh, Mr Hammond.

John Hammond:
Aha! [Approaches happily shaking Ellie's hand] I'm sorry about the dramatic entrance Dr. Sattler, but we are in a wee bit of a hurry.

Ellie Sattler:
[Timidly] Did I say jerk?

John Hammond:
[Brandishes the Champagne bottle] Will you have a drink? We won't let it get warm. Come along, sit down.

Ellie Sattler:
Here, let me… [reaches for several glasses]

John Hammond:
I'll get a glass or two, no, no, no, no, I can manage this. I know my way around the kitchen. [Begins to pour champagne into the glasses] Now, I'll get right to the point. Um, I like ya, both of ya. I can tell instantly about people, it's a gift. I own an island of the coast of Costa Rica, I've leased it from the government and I've spent the last five years setting up a kind of biological preserve. Really spectacular, spared no expense. Make the one I've got down in Kenya look like a petting zoo. And there's no doubt our attraction will drive kids out of their minds.

Alan Grant:
[Sarcastically] And what are those?

Ellie Sattler:
[Teasingly] Small versions of adults, honey.

John Hammond:
And not just kids, everyone. We're going to open next year. That is, if the lawyers don't kill me first. I don't care for lawyers, do you?

Ellie Sattler & Alan Grant:
[Together] We don't really know any.

John Hammond; Well, I do, I'm afraid. There's a particular pebble in my shoe, represents my investors. Says that they insist on outside opinions.

Ellie Satller:
What kinds of opinions?

John Hammond:
Well, your kind, not to put a too fine a point on it. I mean, let's face it. In you particular field, you are the top minds. And if i could just persuade you to sign off one the park, you know, to give it you endorsement, maybe even pen a wee testimonial, I could get back on shedual' uh, Schedule.

Ellie Satller:
Why would they care what we think?

Alan Grant:
What kind of park is this

John Hammond:
It's right up your alley. [passes of the glasses of champagne] I'll tell you what, why don't you come down, just the pair of ya, for the weekend? I'd love to have the opinion of a paleobotanist as well, I've got a jet standing by at Choteau.

Alan Grant:
Look, I'm sorry this is impossible.

Ellie Sattler:
Yeah, we…

Alan Grant:
We just dug up a new skeleton.

John Hammond:
I could compensate you by fully funding your dig.

Alan Grant:
This is a very unusual time…

John Hammond:
For a further three years.

[Sattler and Grant share a Sure, why not? look]

Ellie Sattler:
Well, uh, where's the plane?

Alan Grant:
[admiring the Brachiosaurus] How did you do this?

John Hammond:
I'll show you.

Donald Gennaro:
The full 50 miles of perimeter fence are in place?

John Hammond:
[in a annoyed tone] And the concrete moats, and the motion sensor tracking systems. Donald, dear boy, relax. Try to enjoy yourself.

Donald Gennaro:
Let's get something straight, John. This is not a weekend excursion. This is a serious investigation of the stability of the island. Your investors, who I represent, are deeply concerned. Forty-eight hours from now, if they're not convinced, I'm not convinced. I'll shut you down, John.

John Hammond:
[chuckles] In forty-eight hours, I'll be accepting your apologies.

[Discussing Velociraptors]

Alan Grant:
What kind of metabolism do they have? What's their growth rate?

Robert Muldoon:
They're lethal at eight months. And I do mean lethal. I've hunted most things that can hunt you, but the way these things move...

Alan Grant:
Fast for a biped?

Robert Muldoon:
Cheetah speed. Fifty, sixty miles an hour if they ever got into the open. And they're astonishing jumpers.

John Hammond:
Yes, yes, yes, that's why we're taking extreme precautions.

Alan Grant:
Do they show intelligence? Because their brain cavities—

Robert Muldoon:
They show extreme intelligence. Even problem-solving intelligence. Especially the big one. We bred eight originally, but when she came in, she took over the pride and killed all but two of the others. That one…when she looks at you, you can see she's working things out. It's why we have to feed them like this; she had them all attacking the fences when the feeders came.

Ellie Sattler:
The fences are electrified, right?

Robert Muldoon:
That's right, but they never attacked the same place twice. They were testing the fences for weaknesses, systematically. They remember.

John Hammond:
[eating several bowls of ice cream] They were all melting.

Ellie Sattler:
Malcolm's okay for now. I gave him a shot of morphine.

John Hammond:
They'll be fine. Who better to get the children through Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert? You know the first attraction I built when I came down from Scotland…was a flea circus. Petticoat Lane. Really quite wonderful. We had, uh…a wee trapeze, a merry-go— carousel. Heh. And a see-saw. They all moved, motorized, of course, but people would say they could see the fleas. No, I can see the fleas. Mummy, can't you see the fleas? Clown fleas, highwire fleas and fleas on parade. But with this place…I wanted to give them something that wasn't an illusion. Something that was real. Something they could see, and touch. An aim not devoid of merit.

Ellie Sattler:
But you can't think through this one, John. You have to feel it.

John Hammond:
You're right, you're absolutely right. Hiring Nedry was a mistake, that's obvious. We're over-dependent on automation, I can see that now. Now, the next time everything's correctable. Creation is an act of sheer will. Next time it'll be flawless.

Ellie Sattler:
It's still the flea circus. It's all an illusion.

John Hammond:
When we have control—

Ellie Sattler:
You never had control! That's the illusion! Now I was overwhelmed by the power of this place. But I made a mistake, too. I didn't have enough respect for that power and it's out now. The only thing that matters now are the people we love. Alan, Lex and Tim…John, they're out there where people are dying. So… [takes a spoonful of ice cream] it's good.

John Hammond:
Spared no expense.

John Hammond:
How can we stand in the light of discovery and not act?

Ian Malcolm:
Oh, what's so great about discovery? It's a violent, penetrative act that scars what it observes. What you call discovery…I call the rape of the natural world.

Ellie Sattler:
Well, the question is, how can you know anything about an extinct ecosystem? And therefore, how could you ever assume that you can control it? You have plants in this building that are poisonous; you picked them because they look good. But these are aggressive living things that have no idea what century they're in, and they'll defend themselves, violently if necessary.

John Hammond:
Dr. Grant, if there's one person here who could appreciate what I'm trying to do...

Alan Grant:
The world's just changed so radically, and we're all trying to catch up. I don't want to jump to any conclusions, but look: Dinosaurs and man, two species separated by sixty-five million years of evolution, have just been suddenly... thrown back into the mix together. How can we possibly have the slightest idea what to expect?

John Hammond:
[incredulously] I don't believe it! [chuckles] I don't believe it. You're meant to come down here and defend me against these characters [gestures to Malcolm and Gennaro] and the only one I've got on my side is the blood-sucking lawyer!

Donald Gennaro:
[without irony] Thank you.

Ellie Sattler:
[To Alan] What are you thinking?

Alan Grant:
We're out of a job.

Ian Malcolm:
Don't you mean extinct?

Ellie Sattler:
I can see the shed from here. We can make it if we run.

Robert Muldoon:
No, we can't.

Ellie Sattler:
Why not?

Robert Muldoon:
Because we're being hunted.

Ellie Sattler:
Oh, God…

Robert Muldoon:
In the bushes, straight ahead. It's alright.

Ellie Sattler:
Like hell it is.

[Last lines of the film, as the group piles into a jeep to leave the park]

Alan Grant:
Mr. Hammond, after careful consideration, I've decided not to endorse your park.

John Hammond:
So have I.

[Noticing the glitches in the tour program]

Hammond:
Dennis…our lives are in your hands, and you have butterfingers?

Dennis Nedry:
[laughs] I am totally unappreciated in my time. You could run this whole park from this room with mimimal staff for up to three days. You think that kind of automation is easy? [sips a soda] Or cheap? You know anybody who can network eight Connection Machines and debug two million lines of code for what I bid for this job? Because if he can, I'd like to see him try.

Hammond:
I am sorry about your financial problems, Dennis, I really am, but they are your problems.

Dennis Nedry:
You're right, John, you're absolutely right. You know, everything is my problem.

Hammond:
I will not be drawn into another financial debate with you, Dennis, I really will not!

Dennis Nedry:
There'd be hardly any debate at all.

Hammond:
I don't blame people for their mistakes…but I do ask that they pay for them.

Dennis Nedry:
[sarcastically] Thanks, Dad.

[The guests arrive at the theatre. Hammond walks over to the movie screen where a projected version of himself hobbles into view, clutching a cane topped with an amber-imprisoned mosquito]

Hammond:
Oh, here he comes. Well, here I come. [He walks over to the screen after the screen Hammond appears] Hello, John. [Gestures to audience] Say hello.

Screen Hammond:
Hello, John!

[Hammond fiddles around his pockets and pulls out a few notecards] Oh, I've got lines.

Screen Hammond:
How did I get here?

Hammond:
Well, let me show you. First, I'll need a drop of blood. Your blood. [He takes out a needle and pokes the screen Hammond's finger with it]

Screen Hammond:
Ouch! John, that hurt!

Hammond:
Relax, John. It's all part of the miracle of cloning.

[The screen shows two identical Hammonds]

Screen Hammond #1:
Hello, John.

Screen Hammond #2:
Hello, John.

[A third Hammond appears beside the second]

Screen Hammond #2:
Hello.

Screen Hammond #3:
Hello, John.

Alan Grant:
[As the screen Hammonds continue to multiply and greet each other, flooding the screen] Cloning from what? Loy extraction has never recreated an intact DNA strand.

Ian Malcolm:
Not without massive sequence gaps.

Ellie Sattler:
Palaeo-DNA from what source? Where do you get 100-million-year-old dinosaur blood?

[As the presentation goes on, an animated DNA strand flies out of the screen Hammond's finger, slides down his head and raps on his shoulder]

Screen Hammond:
Oh, Mr. DNA! Where'd you come from?

Mr. DNA:
From your blood. Just one drop of your blood contains billions of strands of DNA, the building blocks of life! [He appears behind a blue background and takes over the presentation] A DNA strand, like me, is a blueprint for building a living thing. And sometimes, animals that went extinct millions of years ago, like dinosaurs, left their blueprints behind for us to find. We just had to know where to look. [He pushes away the blueprint background to show a mosquito on the back of a dinosaur] A hundred million years ago, there were mosquitoes, just like today. And just like today, they fed on the blood of animals. Even dinosaurs. [The mosquito, its abdomen filled with dinosaur blood, flies to a tree. The next scene shows a real mosquito fighting its way through running tree sap] Sometimes, after biting a dinosaur, the mosquito would land on the branch of a tree and get stuck in the sap. [The next scene shows two animated miners digging underground. One of them finds the mosquito imprisoned in the amber] After a long time, the sap got hardened and became fossilized, just like a dinosaur bone, preserving the mosquito inside. This fossilized tree sap, which we call amber, waited millions of years with the mosquito inside until Jurassic Park scientists came along. [The next scene shows a scientist drilling into the amber and extracting the blood from the mosquito with a needle] Using sophisticated techniques, they extract the preserved blood and bingo! Dino DNA! [An orange background shows genetic codes traveling at light speed as if they are cars and trains, making Mr. DNA dizzy] A full DNA strand contains three billion genetic codes. If we looked at screens like these once a second for eight hours a day, it'd take two years to look at the entire strand! It's that long! And since it's so old, it's full of holes! That's where our geneticists take over! [A genetic code speeds by, pushing him off screen to show shows scientists in a laboratory, taking eggs out of incubators] Thinking Machines supercomputers and gene sequencers break down the strand in minutes and virtual reality displays shows our geneticists the gaps in the DNA sequence. Since most animal DNA is 90% identical, we used the complete DNA of a frog… [The next scene shows a bullfrog which later cuts to an actual DNA strand with a hole in it. Mr. DNA carries the letters G, C, A, and T.] …to fill the…holes and…complete the… [He fills in the hole of the DNA strand] …Codes! And now, we can make a baby dinosaur. [The scene then cuts to an egg which hatches into a baby dinosaur]

[Upon discovering an abandoned nest]

Alan Grant:
You know what this is? It's a dinosaur egg. The dinosaurs are breeding.

Tim Murphy:
But Grandpa said all the dinosaurs were girls.

Alan Grant:
Amphibian DNA.

Lex Murphy:
What's that?

Alan Grant:
Well, on the tour, the film said they used frog DNA to fill in the gene sequence gaps; they mutated the dinosaur genetic code and blended it with that of frogs. Now, some West African frogs are able to spontaneously change sex from male to female in a single sex environment. Malcolm was right...life found a way.

[In the park control room]

Ray Arnold:
No, that's crazy, you're out of your mind. He's absolutely out of his mind.

Ellie Sattler:
Wait a minute. What exactly would this mean?

John Hammond:
We're talking about a calculated risk, my dear, which is about the only option left to us. We will never find the command Nedry used; he's covered his tracks far too well, and I think it's obvious now he's not coming back. So shutting down the entire system…

Ray Arnold:
You can get somebody else because I won't do it. I will not-!

John Hammond:
Shutting down the system is the only way to wipe out everything he did. Now, as I understand it, all the systems will then come back on their original start-up modes. Correct?

Ray Arnold:
Theoretically yes. But we've never shut down the entire system before. It might not come back on at all!

Ellie Sattler:
Would we get the phones back?

Ray Arnold:
Yes. Again, in theory.

Robert Muldoon:
What about the lysine contingency? We could put that into effect.

Ellie Sattler:
What's that?

John Hammond:
That is absolutely out of the question!

Ray Arnold:
The lysine contingency is intended to prevent the spread of the animals in case they ever get off the island. Dr. Wu inserted a gene that creates a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism; the animals can't manufacture the amino acid, lysine. Unless they're completely supplied with lysine by us, they slip into a coma and die.

John Hammond:
[angrily] PEOPLE. ARE. DYING! [pause] Will you please shut down the system?

[after raptor enters the kitchen]

Lex Murphy:
Timmy, what is it?

Tim Murphy:
It's a velociraptor.

Lex Murphy:
It's inside.

Dr. Ian Malcolm

Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend

Ray Arnold:
Access main program. Access main security. Access main program grid.

[Nedry's computer begins scrolling YOU DIDN'T SAY THE MAGIC WORD! as a GIF of Nedry appears on screen, wagging its finger]

Computer Nedry:
Ah, ah, ah! You didn't say the magic word!

Ray Arnold:
PLEASE!!! Goddammit! I hate this hacker crap!

Ray Arnold:
[at Nedry's desk] Look at this workstation! What a complete slob!

Robert Muldoon:
The raptor fences aren't out, are they?

Ray Arnold:
No, no. They're still on.

John Hammond:
Why the hell would he turn the other ones off?

Dr. Alan Grant:
The world has just changed so radically, and we're all running to catch up. I don't want to jump to any conclusions, but look… Dinosaurs and man, two species separated by 65 million years of evolution, have just been suddenly thrown back into the mix together. How can we possibly have the slightest idea what to expect?

Dr. Alan Grant:
T. rex doesn't want to be fed. He wants to hunt. Can't just suppress 65 million years of gut instinct.

Dr. Alan Grant:
[on the Triceratops] Ellie, this one was always my favorite when I was a kid. And now I've seen one, it's the most beautiful thing I ever saw.

Ian Malcolm:
John, the kind of control you're attempting simply is…it's not possible. If there is one thing the history of evolution has taught us it's that life will not be contained. Life breaks free, it expands to new territories and crashes through barriers, painfully, maybe even dangerously, but, uh…well, there it is.

Ian Malcolm:
I'm simply saying that life, uh…finds a way.

Ian Malcolm:
Now, eventually you do plan to have dinosaurs on your, on your dinosaur tour, right? Hello?

Robert Muldoon:
[when trying to save a worker from the raptor] Shoot her! SHOOT HER!!

Robert Muldoon:
Dammit, even Nedry knew better than to mess with the raptor fences!

John Hammond:
Welcome... to Jurassic Park.

John Hammond:
[to Donald Gennaro, referring to Ian Malcolm] I bring scientists, you bring a rockstar.

John Hammond:
[Watching Ian Malcolm from a security camera] I really hate that man.

Dennis Nedry:
[Met in jungle by dilophosaurus about to kill him] Yeah...yeah, that's nice. Gotta go!

Dr. Grant:
The odds are we won't leave this island alive.

Reporter:
Are you saying you wouldn't want to get on Isla Sorna and study them if you had the chance?

Dr. Grant:
No force on Earth or Hell could get me on that island.

Amanda:
This is how you make dinosaurs?

Dr. Grant:
No, this is how you play God.

Ellie Degler:
So what were you doing?

Dr. Grant:
Evolving.

Dr. Grant:
Either way... you probably won't get off this island alive.

Dr. Grant:
Oh my god.

Amanda:
What is this?

Dr. Grant:
It's a bird cage.

Amanda:
For what?

Dr. Grant:
It's a T-Rex.

Amanda:
No, it's gotta be something bigger.

Paul:
So what do we do ?

Udesky:
Look for your son... but in the direction they're going.

Udesky:
If we split up, I'm going with you guys.

Dr. Grant:
Reverse Darwinism - survival of the most idiotic.

Erik:
Be careful with that. T-Rex. It scares some of the smaller ones away but attracts one really big one with the fin.

Dr. Grant:
This is T-Rex pee?

Dr. Grant:
How'd you get it?

Erik:
You don't wanna know.

Erik:
I read both of your books. I liked the first one more. Before you were on the island. You liked dinosaurs back then.

Dr. Grant:
Back then they hadn't tried to eat me yet.

Dr. Grant:
On this island there is no such thing as safe.

Dr. Grant:
I have a theory that there are two kinds of boys. There are those that want to be astronomers, and those that want to be astronauts. The astronomer, or the paleontologist, gets to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety.

Erik:
But then you never get to go into space.

Dr. Grant:
Exactly. That's the difference between imagining and seeing: to be able to touch them. And that's... that's all that Billy wanted.

Erik:
Dr. Grant, know something Dr. Grant? Billy was right.

Paul Kirby:
What was that?

Billy Brennan:
That's a Tyrannosaurus.

Dr. Grant:
I don't think so. It sounds bigger.

Dr. Grant:
We haven't landed yet.

Dr. Grant:
It's OK. It's dead.

Dr. Grant:
Nobody move a muscle.

Dr. Grant:
Sh*t!

Dr. Grant:
Great. I'm in the worst place in the world and I'm not even being paid for it.

Dr. Grant:
Well... that's the important thing.

Dr. Grant:
Did you read Malcolm's book?

Dr. Grant:
So?

Erik:
I don't know. It was kinda preachy. And too much Chaos. Everything Chaos. It just seemed like the guy was high on himself.

Dr. Grant:
That's two things we have in common.

Billy Brennan:
So Mr. Kirby when you climbed K2 did you base camp at twenty-five or thirty-thousand feet?

Paul Kirby:
Thirty-thousand feet, we were pretty close to the top.

Billy Brennan:
You were about a thousand feet above actually.

Cooper:
Through our church.

Enrique Cardoso:
Here you go, my friend.

Ben Hildebrand:
Make sure you get as close as you can! I'll give you something extra if you make it a good trip!

Enrique Cardoso:
Hey, I'm gonna get you close, my friend, but not too close, eh. You don't want to be eaten.

Erik:
Where do you think they're going?

Dr. Grant:
I Don't know. Maybe just looking for new nesting grounds. It's a whole new world for them.

Amanda:
I dare 'em to nest in Enid, Oklahoma.

Paul:
Let's go home.

Billy Brennan:
I saved your hat.

Alan Grant:
Well, that's the important thing.

[As Alan is with Charlie playing with the toy dinosaurs]

Dr. Alan Grant:
Actually Charlie, those are herbivores. They really wouldn't be interested in fighting with each other. But these ones here are carnivores, and they really like fighting with each other. They use their teeth and claws to rip each other's throats out.

Ellie:
[approaching] Alan, he's three. Let's wait 'til he's five.

Ellie:
So what are you working on now?

Alan:
Raptors mostly.

Ellie:
My...favorite.

Alan:
Do you remember the sounds they made?

Ellie:
I try not to.

Dr. Grant:
All our theories about raptor intelligence, what they were capable of, we weren't even close.

Ellie:
Tell me.

Dr. Grant:
Well, we did cranium scans of a fossil skull. We found what looks like a very sophisticated resonating chamber.

Ellie:
Wait a second? So we were right. They had the ability to vocalize.

Dr. Grant:
I'm convinced that's the key to their social intelligence.

Ellie:
Which explains why they could work together as a team.

Dr. Grant:
And coordinate their attacks to the prey wouldn't know what was going on.

Ellie:
They could talk to each other.

Dr. Grant:
To a degree we never imagined. Elle, they were smart. They were smarter than dolphins or whales. They were smarter than primates.

Ellie:
You're still the best. I mean that.

Dr. Grant:
The last of my breed.

Symposium Leader:
Does anyone have a question?

[The entire audience raises their hands]

Dr. Grant:
Fine. Does anyone have a question that does not relate to Jurassic Park?

[several audience members lower their hands]

Dr. Grant:
...Or the incident in San Diego, which I did not witness.

[The entire audience except one person lowers their hands]

Dr. Grant:
Yes, sir?

Male Student:
Your theory on raptors is good and all, but isn't all this conjecture kind of moot? I mean, once the U.N. and Costa Rica and everyone decides how to handle that second island, scientists will just go in and look for themselves.

Dr. Grant:
Dinosaurs lived sixty five million years ago. What is left of them is fossilized in the rocks, and it is in the rock that real scientists make real discoveries. Now what John Hammond and InGen did at Jurassic Park is create genetically engineered theme park monsters, nothing more and nothing less.

Female Student:
Are you saying you wouldn't want to get onto Isla Sorna and study them, if you had the chance?

Dr. Grant:
No force on earth or heaven could get me on that island.

Billy Brennen:
So, how'd it go?

Dr. Grant:
Well, it's not too late to change your major, Billy.

Billy Brennen:
Not good, huh?

Billy:
You like computers, right?

Dr. Grant:
I like the abacus, Billy.

Paul Kirby:
I've made a lot of friends in high places. In this case, the Costa Rican government.

Amanda Kirby:
Dr. Grant, you have no idea how important it is to us that you come along. It would make all the difference.

Alan:
Mrs. Kirby, I...I...

Paul:
And of course, we'd love to make a contribution to your research here. So... [pulls out a checkbook] I could write all kinds of numbers on this check, Dr. Grant. Tell me...what's it gonna take?

Billy:
Alan, I wanted to thank you bringing me along on this.

Dr. Alan Grant:
Yeah, well the bones will still be there when we get back; that's the great thing about bones, they never run away. And the truth is...[sotto voce] You got me into this, and I have no intention of being on my own with these people.

Billy:
So, how do you know the Kirbys?

Cooper:
Uh, through our church.

Udesky:
Cooper, if you see anything, yell up.

Cooper:
[sarcastically] Nah, I thought I'd keep it to myself.

[As Paul and Amanda explain they are in the island to rescue their son Eric]

Dr. Grant:
Alright, so why me?

Paul:
He said we needed someone who'd been on the island before.

Udesky:
Yes, but I did not tell you to kidnap somebody.

Dr. Grant:
I have never been on this island.

Paul:
Sure you have. You wrote that book.

Billy:
That was Isla Nublar. This is Isla Sorna, Site B.

Udesky:
You mean that there are two islands with dinosaurs on them?

Paul and Amanda:
All right, you just stay out of this!

Dr. Grant:
So, how long have they been missing?

Paul:
Eight weeks.

Amanda:
Almost eight weeks now.

Dr. Grant:
Billy, we go back to the plane and salvage what we can. Then we make for the coast.

Paul:
Dr. Grant, we're not leaving this island without our son.

Dr. Grant:
Then you can go look for him, or you can stay with us as long as you don't hold us up. Either way, you probably won't get off this island alive. [Alan and Billy head off]

Paul:
[to Udesky] So...what do we do?

Udesky:
Well, we search for your son...in the direction that they're going.

Paul:
Excellent. Excellent. [The trio quickly hurry after them]

[After Billy photographs a Spinosaurus Footprint]

Dr. Grant:
How would you classify it, Billy?

Billy:
Well, it's a super-predator. Suchomimus; [makes a hand motion] Snout.

Dr. Grant:
No, think bigger.

Billy:
Baryonx?

Dr. Grant:
Not with that sail. Spinosaurus aegypticus.

Billy:
I don't remember that on InGen's list.

Dr. Grant:
That's because it wasn't on their list, and it makes you wonder what else they were up to.

Billy:
[noticing Paul struggling with getting his backpack on] So Mr. Kirby, when you climbed K-2, did you base camp at 25 or 30,000 feet?

Paul:
[hesitatingly] 30,000 feet. We were pretty close to the top.

Billy:
You were about 1,000 feet above it, actually.

Paul:
No, no. That's a common misconception.

Dr. Grant:
Mr. Kirby, there's no such thing as Kirby Enterprises, is there?

Paul:
It's Kirby's Paint and Tile Plus. The Plus stands for bathroom fixtures; we're in the Westgate Shopping Center in Enid, Oklahoma.

Billy:
So I don't suppose that check you wrote us is any good.

Paul:
Alright, now, now-

Dr. Grant:
[muttering] This is good.

Paul:
Listen to me. I will pay you the money, no matter what…

Dr. Grant:
This is good! Here we are on the worst place on earth, and we're not even being paid!

Paul:
Alright, now wait, fellas. Hold on. I’ll make this up to you. If you ever do a bathroom or a kitchen…

Paul:
Dr. Grant says that a bad idea.

Amanda:
Dr. Grant. Dr. Grant says-

Paul:
What's the good of hiring an expert if you're not gonna use his advice?

Amanda:
Yeah, except Dr. Grant isn't looking for Eric. He's looking for the coast.

Paul:
Okay, fine. Go ahead and scream. And then when that tricycloplots attacks you, don't come crying to me.

Amanda:
[muttering] Don't worry about that.

Paul:
What?

Amanda:
Nothing.

Paul:
What did you say?

Amanda:
Never mind

Paul:
What did you say?

Amanda:
God, Paul, just drop it.

[As they continue to argue]

Udesky:
[to Billy] If we split up, I'm going with you guys.

Dr. Grant:
What are you doing?!

Billy:
I was photographing the nest.

Dr. Grant:
Don't do that again.

Billy:
Sorry.

Dr. Grant:
If I lose you, it's just me and the damn tourists.

Dr. Grant:
This is T. rex... pee?

[Eric nods]

Dr. Grant:
How'd you get it?

Eric:
You don't wanna know.

Dr. Grant:
Eric, I have to tell you, I'm astonished that you lasted eight weeks on this island.

Eric:
[startled] Is that all it's been?

Dr. Grant:
Well, you're alive and that's the important thing. And thanks to you, that's one thing we have in common. [after a moment] Did you read Malcolm's book?

Eric:
Yeah.

Dr. Grant:
So?

Eric:
I-I don't know. I mean, it was kind of preachy. And too much chaos. Everything's chaos. It seemed like the guy was kind of high on himself.

Dr. Grant:
[smiling] That's two things that we have in common.

Paul:
All I'm saying... It's not your fault.

Amanda:
No, if he'd been with you, he'd be completely safe. You drive five miles under the speed limit, Paul. And I've totaled three cars in three years.

Paul:
Well, not three. The Buick wasn't really totaled. I just said it was 'cause I wanted to get the S.U.V.

Amanda:
I am so sorry you have to be here.

Paul:
I'm not.

Eric:
Know what this is?

Dr. Grant:
That's a raptor claw. I used to have one. A fossil.

Eric:
Mine is new.

[After the group reunites, with a fence in between them]

Paul:
How did you know we were here?

Eric:
The phone. That stupid jingle from the store, I heard it.

Paul:
My phone?

Eric:
Yeah, your satellite phone.

Amanda:
Where is it?

Paul:
I don't have it.

Amanda:
When did you use it last?

Paul:
Uh, uh, on the plane. I got a call on the plane and... [stops in realization]

Amanda:
What? What?!

Paul:
I loaned it to Nash. He must've had it when he-

[Phone ringtones and the group turn in horror to see the Spinosaurs staring at them]

Dr. Grant:
Run.

[After Dr. Grant decides to hold on to the raptor eggs]

Paul:
What are you doing? Those things are after us because of those.

Dr. Grant:
Those things know we have the eggs. I drop them in the river, they'll still be after us.

Paul:
What if they catch us with 'em?

Dr. Grant:
What is they catch us without 'em?

Dr. Alan Grant:
[upon reaching Isla Sorna and seeing the dinosaurs] My God, I'd forgotten.

Dr. Alan Grant:
You cannot land on this island!

Dr. Alan Grant:
Will you tell your wife to stop making noise? That is a very, very bad idea.

Dr. Alan Grant:
[as the raptor is cawing] My God. He's calling for help.

Dr. Alan Grant:
[after Billy said he stole raptor eggs with the best intentions] Some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions. You know, as far as I'm concerned, you're no better than the people who built this place.

Paul Kirby:
[to Amanda] We're gonna find him. You listening to me? We're gonna find him. The kid's got resources. Remember what it was like to try to ground him?

Paul Kirby:
[to Dr. Grant about the satellite phone] Turn off the power. You've got juice for maybe one call. Whatever you do, don't call the U.S. Embassy. They won't do a damn thing.

Udesky:
Nothing to worry about sir. It's going to be a walk in the park.

Billy Brennan:
[after he and Paul save Amanda from the raptors] They set a trap. They actually set a trap.

Dr. Alan Grant:
You do not understand. On this island, there is no such thing as safe!

Dr. Alan Grant:
(about velociraptors) All our theories about raptor intelligence, what they were capable of, we weren't even close! They were smart. They were smarter than dolphins or whales. They were even smarter than primates!

Dr. Alan Grant:
(after Billy said he stole raptor eggs with the best intentions) With the best intentions!? Some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the 'best intentions.' You know, as far as I'm concerned, you're no better than the people who built this place.

Dr. Alan Grant:
(calling Ellie for help while being attacked by a spinosaurus) The river... Site B! The river!

Dr. Alan Grant:
That's the important thing.

Dr. Alan Grant:
(Finding a dinosaur carcass) It's okay, it's dead. (T-Rex raises it's head from behind the dead dinosaur) Nobody move a muscle! (T-rex roars and everyone besides Grant runs away)

Dr. Alan Grant:
God bless you, Ellie.

Dr. Alan Grant:
(after the entire audience raises their hands with questions) Does anyone have any questions not relating to Jurassic Park? (several audience members lower their hands) Or the incident in San Diego, which I did not witness. (The entire audience except one person lowers their hands)

Dr. Alan Grant:
(in answer to a question whether palaeontology is relevant given the living dinosaurs on Isla Sorna) Dinosaurs lived sixty five million years ago. What is left of them is fossilised in the rocks, and it is in the rock that real scientists make real discoveries! What John Hammond and InGen did at Jurassic Park is create genetically engineered theme park monsters! Nothing more and nothing less. [...] No force on earth or heaven could get me on that island.

Eric Kirby:
(about Ellie Sattler) Wow! You have to thank her now. She sent the Navy and the Marines!

Paul Kirby:
Let's go home.

Billy:
Alan, I wanted to thank you bringing me along on this.

Dr. Alan Grant:
Yeah, well the bones will still be there when we get back; that's the great thing about bones, they never run away. And the truth is...[sotto voce] You got me into this, and I have no intention of being on my own with these people!

Paul Kirby:
[hearing distant roar] What was that?

Billy:
That's a Tyrannosaurus.

Dr. Alan Grant:
I don't think so. Sounds bigger.

Amanda Kirby:
[about the abandoned laboratory] Is this how you make dinosaurs?

Dr. Alan Grant:
No. This is how you play God.

Eric Kirby:
I read both your books. I liked your first one more, before you were on the island. You liked dinosaurs back then.

Dr. Alan Grant:
Back then they hadn't tried to eat me yet!

Paul Kirby:
We called everyone; we did everything we could. No one would help us. The Costa Rican Government says this is a no-fly zone; the US Embassy, that's our US Embassy, told us we should accept the inevitable. Can you believe that!?

Billy:
You let a twelve-year old go parasailing alone!

Paul, Amanda:
No!

Amanda Kirby:
He was with a friend.

Paul Kirby:
Ben Hilldebrand.

Amanda Kirby:
Paul and I divorced about a year ago.

Dr. Alan Grant:
Alright, so why me?

Paul Kirby:
He told me he needed someone who's been on the island before.

Udesky:
Yes, but I did not tell you to kidnap someone.

Dr. Alan Grant:
I have never been on this island!

Paul Kirby:
Sure you have. You wrote that book.

Billy:
That was Isla Nublar. This is Isla Sorna, Site B.

Udesky:
You mean that there are two islands with dinosaurs on them?

Paul and Amanda KirbyÂ :
All right, you just stay out of this!

Dr. Alan Grant:
So, how long have they been missing?

Paul Kirby:
Eight weeks.

Amanda Kirby:
Almost eight weeks now. [An awkward pause]

Dr. Alan Grant:
Billy, we'll go back to the plane and salvage what we can. Then we make for the coast.

Paul Kirby:
Dr. Grant, we're not leaving this island without our son.

Dr. Alan Grant:
Then you can go look for him, or you can stay with us as long as you don't hold us up. Either way, you probably won't get off this island alive. [Alan and Billy head off]

Paul Kirby:
So what do we do?

Udesky:
Well, we search for your son...in the direction they're going.

[After the group's encounter with a large carnosaur]

Dr. Alan Grant:
How would you classify it, Billy?

Billy:
Obviously a super-predator. Suchomimus, that snout.

Dr. Alan Grant:
No, think bigger.

Billy:
Baryonx?

Dr. Alan Grant:
Not with that sail. Spinosaurus aegypticus.

Billy:
I don't remember that on InGen's list.

Dr. Alan Grant:
That's because it wasn't on their list. And it makes you wonder what else they were up to.

Paul Kirby:
[hesitatingly] 30,000 feet. We were pretty close to the top.

Billy:
Yea, you were about 1,000 feet above it, actually.

Paul Kirby:
No, no, no. That's a common mistake

Dr. Alan Grant:
Mr. Kirby, there's no such thing as Kirby Enterprises, is there?

Paul Kirby:
It's Kirby's Paint and Tile Plus. The Plus stands for bathroom fixtures; we're in the Lakewood Shopping Center in Enid, Oklahoma.

Billy:
So I suppose that check you wrote us is no good.

Paul Kirby:
No, I will pay you the money!

Dr. Alan Grant:
This is good! Here we are on the worst place on earth, and we're not even getting paid!

Paul Kirby:
OK, look, if you ever need to do a kitchen or bathroom...

Dr. Alan Grant:
This is T-rex... pee?

Dr. Alan Grant:
How'd you get it?

Eric Kirby:
You don't wanna know.

Paul Kirby:
[to Amanda] We're going to find him. He's very ingenious. Remember what it was like to try and ground him?

Dr. Alan Grant:
[pausing] Where's Billy?

[goes back to the raptor nest and sees Billy messing with his lucky bag]

Dr. Alan Grant:
What are you doing?!

Billy:
I was photographing the nest.

Dr. Alan Grant:
Don't do that again!

Billy:
Sorry.

Dr. Alan Grant:
If I lose you, it's just me and the damn tourists.

Billy:
I rescued your hat.

Dr. Alan Grant:
(jokingly) Well, that's the important thing.

Amanda Kirby:
[after watching pterodactyls fly away from the island] I dare them to nest in ... Oklahoma!

Paul Kirby:
[looking lovingly at Amanda] Let's go home.

Ian Malcolm:
(regarding Kelly) The queen, the goddess, my inspiration.

Ian Malcolm:
[To Sarah, regarding his attempts to contact the trailer] For once in your life, would it kill you to pick it up?!

Ian Malcolm:
[Regarding the Tyrannosaur that just threw one of the team's vehicles over the cliff] Mommy's very angry.

Ian Malcolm:
[To Kelly after she kills a raptor using Gymnastics] The school cut you from their team?

Ian Malcolm:
[To Ludlow after the T-Rex enters San Diego] Now you're John Hammond.

Ian Malcolm:
[Off Nick and Eddie's reactions to the dinosaurs] Oh yeah Ooh, aah, that's how it always starts. But then there's running and screaming.

Ian Malcolm:
[To Ludlow regarding Ludlow's plan to transport dinosaurs to the mainland] Taking dinosaurs off this island is the worst idea in the long, sad history of bad ideas, and I'm gonna be there when you learn that.

Ian Malcolm:
[Trying to rally calm after the Tyrannosaurs attack the camp] Stay down! Stay down! Don't move! DON'T MOVE!

Ian Malcolm:
[Seeing the T-rexs about to attack the trailer] Hang on, this is about to get very bad.

Ian Malcolm:
(seeing the ship about to crash into the docks) We should have stayed in the damn car!

Ian Malcolm:
(about the T-Rex) When he sees us with his kid, isn't he gonna be like You!?

Sarah Harding:
I've worked around predators since I was 20 years old. Lions, jackals, hyenas... you.

Sarah Harding:
I need something pliable... Spit. [Holds out her hand and Nick spits saliva into it] Your *gum*!

Eddie Carr:
[Regarding Malcom's frustrated handling of the sat phone] Violence and technology? Not good bedfellows!

Eddie Carr:
[Hearing the baby T-Rex's cry when the jeep passed by] What the hell was that?

John Hammond:
[To Malcom] You were right and I was wrong. There! Did you ever expect to hear me say such a thing?

John Hammond:
Now it's only a matter of time before this lost world is found and pillaged.

John Hammond:
(last lines) It is absolutely imperative that we work with the Costa Rican Department of Biological Preserves to establish a set of rules for the preservation and isolation of that island. These creatures require our absence to survive, not our help. And if we could only step aside and trust in nature, life will find a way.

Peter Ludlow:
[John] Hammond's grasp exceeded his reach, mine does not.

Peter Ludlow:
Wait!Wait!Wait!Wait!Wait! [after seeing the Tyrannosaur approaching him ]

Roland Tembo:
[Reading from a pamphlet on dinosaurs] It'll be a pachy... pachycepl... oh hell, the fat head with the bald spot. Friar Tuck!

Roland Tembo:
[Loses the pamphlet] The one with the big red horn, the pompador. Elvis!

Roland Tembo:
Come on, let's get this movable feast underway!

Roland Tembo:
Do you want to set up a base camp or a buffet?

Kelly Malcolm:
(about the pissed off woman on the radio) Boy, is she mad at you!

Ian Malcolm:
I feel sorry for this guy Enrique.

Kelly Malcolm:
She doesn't even have Sega. She's such a troglodyte.

Ian Malcolm:
Cruel, but good word use.

Eddie Carr:
[Refering to a platform] It's a High Hide. A High Hide. [off Malcolm's look] See you go up and you hide, high. It goes up to where the trees are, and keeps the researchers out of harms way.

Ian Malcolm:
Actually it'll put them at a very convient biting height.

Nick Van Owen:
...Did some work with Greenpeace once in a while.

Ian Malcolm:
Greenpeace? What drew you there?

Nick Van Owen:
[Grinning] Women. Eighty percent female Greenpeace.

Ian Malcolm:
That's noble.

Nick Van Owen:
Nah, noble was last year. This year I'm getting paid. Hammond's cheque cleared or I wouldn't be going on this wild goose chase.

Ian Malcolm:
Ah where you're going is the only place in the world where the geese chase you!

Eddie Carr:
I loaded the enhanced venom of Conus purpurascens, the South Sea cone shell. Most powerful neurotoxin in the world. Acts within a two-thousandth of a second. Faster than the nerve-conduction velocity. The animal's down before it feels the prick of the dart.

Ian Malcolm:
Is there an antidote?

Eddie Carr:
What, like if you shot yourself in the foot? Don't do that. You'd be dead before you realized you'd had an accident.

Peter Ludlow [Hearing the infant cry out of the Cargohold] Are You There?

Peter Ludlow [He notices the Muzzle on the floor and sees the infant] Ah so there you are!

Tyrannosaur [Roars towards Ludlow, he is quite terrified]

Peter Ludlow Wait Wait Wait [The rex breaks Ludlow's leg and puts him down] Wait! Wait! Wait!

Eddie Carr:
[Refering to the Dinosaurs] Wow. Is this even possible?

Ian Malcolm:
[Incredulous] What? This? What did you think you were going to document? What did you think you were going to see?

Nick Van Owen:
Animals. Maybe big Iguanas.

Ian Malcolm:
[Sighs] Fruitcakes.

Eddie Carr:
(seeing the wrecked RV hanging off the edge of a cliff) Ian? Sarah? Nick? Nick!

Nick Van Owen:
Yeah, we're in here.

Eddie Carr:
Wait, wait! I'm coming! I'm coming! (tries opening door, but it won't open) God damn it! I'm coming! (climbs in through shattered windshield) What did this?

Ian Malcolm:
Kelly! What did you do with Kelly?

Eddie Carr:
It's okay, she's in the High Hide! Who's hurt, what do you need?

Ian Malcolm:
We need rope!

Eddie Carr:
Rope? What, anything else?

Ian Malcolm:
Yeah, three double cheeseburgers with everything.

Nick Van Owen:
No onions on mine!

Sarah Harding:
And an apple turnover!

Peter Ludlow:
[walking downstairs in John Hammond's mansion] Well, Dr. Malcolm...Dr. Malcolm. [begins signing some paperwork] Here to trade campfire stories with my uncle?

Ian Malcolm:
You can convince the Washington Post and Sceptical Enquirer of what you want, but I was there. I know what happened, and so do you.

Peter Ludlow:
Do you actually believe that everyone who chose discretion did so for a nefarious motive? Even Lex and Tim?

Ian Malcolm:
Leave them out of it. It's not a game.

Peter Ludlow:
No, it isn't. You signed a nondisclosure agreement before you went to the island that expressely forbade you from discussing anything you saw. You violated that agreement.

Ian Malcolm:
Yeah, I did, and you lied. You twisted the facts surrounding the deaths of three people, and you stuff misinformation down the public's throat which made me look like a nut. It hasn't been so good for my livelyhood...

Peter Ludlow:
We made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries.

Ian Malcolm:
That was a payoff and an insult. When you spin reality, when you cover up evidence it hurts more than just my reputation, it hurts...

Peter Ludlow:
As I recall, your university revoked your tenure for your selling wild stories to the press.

Ian Malcolm:
I didn't sell anything, I never took a cent, and I told the truth.

Peter Ludlow:
Your version of it.

Ian Malcolm:
There are no versions of the truth. And I'll tell you something, InGen can't keep...

Peter Ludlow:
InGen is my responsibility now, Doctor, and I will jealously defend its interests.

Ian Malcolm:
Your responsibility? What about Mr. Hammond?

Peter Ludlow:
It is our board of directors that I must look in the eye, not my uncle. Really, you must trust me, these problems of yours are about to be rendered moot. In a few weeks time, they'll be long forgotten. [Pats him on the arm]

Ian Malcolm:
[Grips Ludlow's arm, threatening] Not by me.

Peter Ludlow:
Careful. This suit cost more than your education.

John Hammond:
Thank God for Site B.

Ian Malcom:
Site B?

John Hammond:
Isla Nublar was just the showroom, something for the tourists. Site B was the factory floor; that was on Isla Sorna, eighty miles from Nublar. We bred the animals there, and nurtured them for a few months and then moved them into the park.

Ian Malcom:
Really? I did not know that.

John Hammond:
Now, after the accident in the park, Hurricane Clarissa wiped out our facility on Site B; call it an act of God. We had to evacuate, of course, and the animals were released to mature on their own. Life will find a way as you once so eloquently put it. And by now, we have a complete ecological system on the island, with dozens of species living in their own social groups without fences, without boundaries, without constraining technology and for four years, I've tried to keep it safe from human interference.

Ian Malcolm:
[stammering] Well, that's right, that's right, hopefully you've kept this island quarantined and contained, but, er, I'm in shock about all this,I mean, that they're still alive. I mean, you bred them lysine-deficient. Shouldn't they have, er, kicked after seven days without supplemental enzymes?

John Hammond:
Yes, but by God, they're flourishing! That's one of a thousand questions I want the team to answer!

Ian Malcolm:
Team?!

John Hammond:
Yes. I've organised an expedition to go in and document them. To make the most spectacular living fossil record the world has ever seen.

Ian Malcolm:
Go in and document? What, you mean with people?

John Hammond:
Yes. The animals won't even know they're there. Very low impact. Strictly observation and documentation. Our satellite infareds show the animals are fiercely territorial. The carnivores are isolated in the interior of the island, so the team can stay on the outer rim. Don't worry, I'm not making the same mistakes again.

Ian Malcolm:
No, you're making all new ones. [exasperated] John...! So there's another island with dinosaurs-no fences this time!- and you want to send people in, very few people, on the ground?! And who are these four lunatics that you're trying to con into this?!

John Hammond:
Well, it was difficult to convince them as to what they were going to see and in the end I had to use my chequebook to get them there. [holds up four dossiers which he hands to Ian] But there's Nick van Owen who's a video documentarian, Eddie Carr who's a field equipment expert. We have our palaeontologist and I was hoping that perhaps you might be the fourth. [Ian rolls his eyes] We've been on the verge of Chapter 11 ever since the accident in the park and there are those in the company who wanted to exploit Site B in order to bail us out. They've been planning it for years, and I have been able to stop them up until now but a few weeks ago, a British family on a yacht cruise stumbled across the island and their wee girl was injured. Oh she's fine, she's fine, but the board has used the incident to take control of InGen from me, and now it's only a matter of time before this lost world is found and pillaged. Public opinion is the one thing I can use to preserve it, but in order to rally that kind of support, I need a complete photo record of those animals alive and in their natural habitat.

Ian Malcolm:
So you went from capitalist to naturalist in just four years. That's something.

Peter Ludlow:
[Speaking into radio headset] This is as good as place as any for Base Camp, I want it up and running in thirty minutes. That's half an hour. Over.

Roland Tembo:
Cancel that order.

Peter Ludlow:
[To Roland] What! Why?

Roland Tembo:
This is a game trail, Mr. Ludlow. Carnivores hunt on game trails. Do you want to set up base camp or a buffet?

Peter Ludlow:
[Into headset] Let's find a new spot, shall we? Over and out.

Roland Tembo:
Peter, if you want me to run your little camping trip, there are two conditions. Firstly, I'm in charge. And when I'm not around, Dieter is. All you need to do is sign the checks and open your case of Scotch when we have a good day. Second condition, my fee - you can keep it. All I want in exchange for my services is the right to hunt one of the tyrannosaurs. A male. A buck only. How and why are my business. Now, if you don't like either of those two conditions, you're on your own. So go ahead. Set up base camp right here, or in a swamp, or in the middle of a rex nest for all I care. But I've been on too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas. Okay?

Peter Ludlow:
[pause, then smiles and gives Roland a thumbs up] Okay!

Nick Van Owen:
You seem like you have a shred of common sense, what the hell are you doing here?

Roland Tembo:
Somewhere on this island is the greatest predator there ever lived. The second greatest predator must take him down.

Nick Van Owen:
[referring to Roland's gun] You gonna use that?

Roland Tembo:
If he doesn't surrender, yes.

Nick Van Owen:
[chuckles] The animal exists on the planet for the first time in tens of millions of years and the only way you can express yourself is to kill it.

Roland Tembo:
Remember that chap about twenty years ago? I forget his name. Climbed Everest without any oxygen, came down nearly dead. When they asked him, they said 'why did you go up there to die?' He said 'I didn't, I went up there to live'.

Peter Ludlow:
Roland, there's a job for you in San Diego if you want it.

Roland Tembo:
No thank you. I believe I've spent enough time in the company of death.

(Sarah and Ian are searching for the T-Rex in San Diego)

Sarah Harding:
How do we find the adult?

Dr. Ian Malcolm:
Just follow the screams.

Officer:
Hey! What the hell you think you're doing?

Ian Malcolm:
Taking the kid. Want to stop us? Shoot us.

Something Has Survived

Cathy:
[hears a weird sound and sees a Compsognathus jump out of the bushes] Well, hello there. What are you? Some sort of bird or something? [the Compy comes closer to see Cathy's sandwich and Cathy takes a piece out] Are you hungry? Take a bite. It's roast beef. It's good. Come on. I won't hurt you. [the Compy takes the meat with its mouth] Mommy! Daddy! You've got to come see this! I found something! [turns around and sees multiple Compsognathuses]

Peter Ludlow:
InGen is my responsibility now, Doctor, I will jealously defend it's interests.

Ian Malcolm:
Your responsibility, what about Mr. Hammond?

Peter Ludlow:
It is our board of directors whom I must look in the eye, not my uncle. Really, you must trust me, your problems are about to be rendered moot. In a few weeks' time, they'll be long forgotten.

Ian Malcolm:
[grabbing Ludlow's arm] Not by me.

Peter Ludlow:
Careful. This suit cost more than your education.

John Hammond:
Don't worry. I'm not making the same mistakes again.

Ian Malcolm:
No, you're making all new ones.

Sarah Harding:
I love you. I just don't need you right now.

Ian Malcolm:
What you need is a good anti-psychotic.

Sarah Harding:
I'll be back in five or six days.

Ian Malcolm:
No, you'll be back in five or six pieces.

Peter Ludlow:
Roland. Where do you think you're going?

Roland Tembo:
To collect my fee, Mr. Ludlow. To collect my fee.

[A compsognathus—compy for short—is sniffing at Stark's foot]

Dieter Stark:
It gives me the creeps. It's like it's not scared.

Robert Burke:
There haven't been any visitors to this island. There's no reason for it to fear man.

[Stark casually lowers his cattle-prod to the compy's head, shocking it and sending it running]

Dieter Stark:
Now it does.

Eddie Carr:
Who's hurt, what do you need?

Ian Malcolm:
We need rope!

Eddie Carr:
Rope? What, anything else?

Ian Malcolm:
Yeah, three double cheeseburgers with everything.

Nick Van Owen:
No onions on mine!

Sarah Harding:
And an apple turnover!

Roland Tembo:
The rex just fed, so he won't be hunting for a while.

Ian Malcolm:
Just fed? I assume you're talking about Eddie? You might show a little more respect, the man saved our lives by giving his.

Roland Tembo:
Then his problems are over. My point is, predators don't hunt when they're not hungry.

Nick Van Owen:
Yeah, only humans do.

Roland Tembo:
Oh, you're breaking my heart. Come on! Saddle up, let's get this moveable feast under way!

Peter Ludlow:
It's easy to criticize someone who generates an idea, assumes the risk.

Ian Malcolm:
When you try to sound like Hammond, it comes off as a hustle. It's not your fault. They say talent skips a generation. I'm sure your kids will be sharp as tacks.

Peter Ludlow:
Hammond's reach exceeded his grasp; mine does not.

Ian Malcolm:
Taking dinosaurs off this island is the worst idea in the long, sad history of bad ideas. And I'm gonna be there when you learn that.

[Ian and Sarah have just stolen an infant Tyrannosaurus as bait for its rampaging parent]

Sarah Harding:
How do we find the adult?

Ian Malcolm:
Follow the screams!

Ian Malcolm:
[to Hammond] So you went from capitalist to naturalist in just four years. That's something.

Ian Malcolm:
[to Hammond] If you want to leave your name on something, fine. But stop putting it on other people's headstones.

Ian Malcolm:
Hey, when the adult sees us once again with his baby, uh, isn't he gonna be like, You!? You know, there may be some, uh, angry recognition.

Sarah Harding:
[to Malcolm] Look. I love that you rode in here on a white horse. I really do. It's very touching, very dramatic. I just need you to show up in a cab now and then, too.

John Hammond:
It's our last chance at redemption.

Peter Ludlow:
Well, Dr. Malcolm. Here to share a few campfire stories with my uncle?

Peter Ludlow:
An extinct animal brought back to life has no rights. It exists because we made it. We patented it. We own it.

Peter Ludlow:
[to Ian] Careful. This suit costs more than your education.

Peter Ludlow:
Fifteen years ago, John Hammond had a dream. Like John himself, the dream was grand. It was outsized. It was bold. It was impractical. It was not to be. Half an hour from now…John Hammond's dream, re-imagined, will come true.

Roland Tembo:
This is a game trail, Mr. Ludlow. Carnivores hunt on game trails. Do you want to set up base camp or a buffet?

 
Gandalf the Grey:
[to Frodo] Keep it secret. Keep it safe.

Gandalf the Grey:
[reading] The year 3434 of the Second Age. Here follows the account of Isildur, the High King of Gondor, at the finding of the Ring of Power. It has come to me, the One Ring. It shall be an heirloom of my Kingdom. All those who follow in my bloodline shall be bound to its fate, for I shall risk no hurt to the Ring. It is precious to me, though I buy it with a great pain. The markings upon the band begin to fade. The writing, which at first was as clear as red flame, has all but disappeared - a secret now that only fire can tell.

Gandalf the Grey:
My dear Frodo, Hobbits really are amazing creatures. You can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a month and yet, after a hundred years, they can still surprise you.

Gandalf the Grey:
Be careful, both of you. The Enemy has many spies in his service; birds and beasts. [to Frodo] Is it safe? Never put it on, for then the agents of the Dark Lord will be drawn to its power. Always remember, Frodo, the Ring is trying to get back to its master. It wants to be found.

Gandalf the Grey:
[reading the inscription on a sarcophagus] Here lies Balin, son of Fundin, Lord of Moria. He is dead then. It's as I feared.

Gandalf the Grey:
[reading the Book of Mazarbul's last entry] They have taken the Bridge and the Second Hall. We have barred the gates, but cannot hold them for long. The ground shakes... Drums. Drums in the deep. We cannot get out. A Shadow moves in the dark... We cannot get out... They are coming.

Gandalf the Grey:
Fool of a Took! Throw yourself in next time, and rid us of your stupidity!

Gandalf the Grey:
[confronting the Balrog on the Bridge of Khazad-dÃ»m] You cannot pass! I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the Flame of Anor. The dark fire will not avail you, Flame of UdÃ»n! Go back to the shadow. You shall not pass!

Gandalf the Grey:
Fly, you fools!

Galadriel:
[opening narration] The world is changed. I feel it in the water. I feel it in the earth. I smell it in the air. Much that once was is lost, for none now live who remember it. It began with the forging of the Great Rings. Three were given to the Elves; immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings. Seven to the Dwarf Lords, great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls. And nine, nine rings were gifted to the Race of Men, who above all else desire power. For within these rings was bound the strength and will to govern each race. But they were all of them deceived, for another ring was made. In the land of Mordor, in the fires of Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged, in secret, a Master Ring to control all others. And into this Ring he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all life. One Ring to rule them all. One by one, the Free Lands of Middle-Earth fell to the power of the Ring. But there were some who resisted. A last alliance of Men and Elves marched against the armies of Mordor. And on the slopes of Mount Doom, they fought for the freedom of Middle-Earth. Victory was near, but the power of the Ring could not be undone. It was in this moment, when all hope had faded, that Isildur, son of the king, took up his father's sword. Sauron, enemy of the free peoples of Middle-Earth, was defeated. The Ring passed to Isildur, who had this one chance to destroy evil forever, but the hearts of Men are easily corrupted. And the Ring of Power has a will of its own. It betrayed Isildur, to his death. And some things that should not have been forgotten were lost. History became legend. Legend became myth. And for two and a half thousand years, the Ring passed out of all knowledge. Until, when chance came, it ensnared a new bearer. The Ring came to the creature Gollum, who took it deep into the tunnels of the Misty Mountains. And there it consumed him. The Ring brought to Gollum unnatural long life. For 500 years, it poisoned his mind. And in the gloom of Gollum's cave, it waited. Darkness crept back into the forests of the world. Rumor grew of a shadow in the East - whispers of a nameless fear. And the Ring of Power perceived its time had now come. It abandoned Gollum. But something happened then the Ring did not intend. It was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable. A Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins of the Shire. For the time will soon come when Hobbits will shape the fortunes of all...

Galadriel:
Farewell, Frodo Baggins. I give you the Light of EÃ¤rendil, our most beloved star. May it be a light for you in dark places, when all other lights go out.

Bilbo Baggins:
[writing his book] The twenty-second day of September in the year 1400 by Shire reckoning. Bag End, Bagshot Row, Hobbiton, West Farthing, The Shire, Middle Earth. The Third Age of this world. There and back again, A Hobbit's tale, by Bilbo Baggins. Now, where to begin? Ah, yes. Concerning Hobbits. Hobbits have been living and farming in the four Farthings of the Shire for many hundreds of years. Quite content to ignore and be ignored by the world of the Big Folk. Middle Earth being, after all, full of strange creatures beyond count. Hobbits must seem of little importance, being neither renowned as great warriors, nor counted amongst the very wise. ... In fact, it has been remarked by some that Hobbits' only real passion is for food. A rather unfair observation as we have also developed a keen interest in the brewing of ales and the smoking of pipeweed. But where our hearts truly lie is in peace and quiet and good tilled earth. For all Hobbits share a love of all things that grow. And yes, no doubt to others, our ways seem quaint. But today of all days, it is brought home to me it is no bad thing to celebrate a simple life.

Bilbo Baggins:
[writing in his book] And so life in the Shire goes on, very much as it has this past age. Full of its own comings and goings with change coming slowly, if it comes at all. For things are made to endure in the Shire, passing from one generation to the next. There's always been a Baggins living here under the Hill, in Bag End. [to himself] And there always will be.

Bilbo Baggins:
So there I was at the mercy of three monstrous trolls. And they were all arguing amongst themselves about how they were going to cook us. Whether it be turned on a spit or whether they should sit on us one by one and squash us into jelly. They spent so much time arguing the witherto's and whyfor's that the sun's first light cracked open over the top of the trees... Poof! And turned them all into stone!

Bilbo Baggins:
Today is my One Hundred and Eleventh birthday! Alas, eleventy one years is far too short a time to live among such excellent and admirable Hobbits. I don't know half of you half as well as I should like and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve. [confused silence] I, uh, I have things to do... I've put this off for far too long. I regret to announce this is the end. I'm going now. I bid you all a very fond farewell. Goodbye. [puts the Ring on and vanishes]

Bilbo Baggins:
[to Frodo] I'm sorry I brought this upon you, my boy. I'm sorry that you must have to carry this burden. I'm sorry for everything.

Sauron:
[speaking to Frodo] You cannot hide. I see you! There is no life in the void...only death.

Sauron:
[speaking to Saruman] Build me an army worthy of Mordor!

Frodo:
You're late.

Gandalf:
A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins. Nor is he early; he arrives precisely when he means to.

Gandalf:
So, how is the old rascal? I hear it is going to be a party of special significance.

Frodo:
You know Bilbo. He's got the whole place in an uproar.

Gandalf:
Well, that should please him.

Frodo:
Half the Shire's been invited. And the rest are turning up anyway.[They laugh]

Frodo:
He's up to something. [Gandalf acts nonchalant] All right then, keep your secrets. But I know you have something to do with it

Gandalf:
Goodness gracious me!

Frodo:
Before you came along we Bagginses were very well thought of.

Gandalf:
Indeed?

Frodo:
Never had any adventures or did anything unexpected.

Gandalf:
If you're referring to the incident with the dragon, I was barely involved. All I did was give your uncle a little nudge out of the door.

Frodo:
Whatever you did, you've been officially labeled a 'disturber of the peace.'

Gandalf:
[surprised] Oh really?

Gandalf:
Frodo suspects something.

Bilbo:
Of course he does! He's a Baggins! Not some blockheaded Bracegirdle from Hardbottle.

Gandalf:
You will tell him, won't you?

Bilbo:
Yes, yes.

Gandalf:
He's very fond of you.

Bilbo:
I know, he'd probably come with me if I asked him to. I think in his heart, Frodo's still in love with the Shire; the woods, the fields, little rivers... I'm old, Gandalf. I know I don't look it, but I'm beginning to feel it in my heart. I feel thin, sort of stretched, like butter scraped over too much bread. I need a holiday, a very long holiday. And I don't expect that I shall return. In fact, I mean not to.

Bilbo:
My dear Bagginses and Boffins. Tooks and Brandybucks. Grubbs! Chubbs! Hornblowers! Bolgers! Bracegirdles! Proudfoots!

Proudfoot:
Proudfeet!

Bilbo:
You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?

Gandalf:
Two eyes, as often as I can spare them.

Bilbo:
I'm leaving everything to him.

Gandalf:
What about this ring of yours? Is that staying too?

Bilbo:
Yes, yes. It's in an envelope over there on the mantelpiece. No, wait... it's right here in my pocket. Isn't that odd, now? And yet, why not? Why shouldn't I keep it?

Gandalf:
I think you should leave the ring behind, Bilbo. Is that so hard?

Bilbo:
Well, no... and yes. [agitated] Now it comes to it, I don't feel like parting with it! It's mine, I found it! It came to me!

Gandalf:
There's no need to get angry.

Bilbo:
Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault! [to himself] It's mine... my own... [Hisses] My precious...

Gandalf:
[alarmed] Precious? It's been called that before, but not by you.

Bilbo:
[angry] Oh, what business is it of yours what I do with my own things?!

Gandalf:
I think you've had that ring quite long enough.

Bilbo:
You want it for yourself!

Gandalf:
BILBO BAGGINS! DO NOT TAKE ME FOR SOME CONJURER OF CHEAP TRICKS! I AM NOT TRYING TO ROB YOU! [gently] I'm trying to help you. [Bilbo, frightened, hugs Gandalf] All your long years, we have been friends. Trust me, as you once did. Let it go.

Bilbo:
You're right, Gandalf. The ring must go to Frodo. Well, it's late, the road is long.

Gandalf:
[sternly] Bilbo. The ring is still in your pocket.

Bilbo:
[sheepish] Oh, yes... of course.

[With great effort, he drops the ring to the floor, and rushes outside, appearing relieved]

Bilbo:
I've thought of an ending for my book. And he lived happily ever after... to the end of his days.

Gandalf:
And I'm sure you will, my friend.

Bilbo:
Goodbye, Gandalf.

[Bilbo and Gandalf shake hands]

Gandalf:
Goodbye, dear Bilbo. [Bilbo sets off] Until our next meeting.

Frodo:
[Reading the inscription on the Ring] There are markings. It's some form of Elvish. I can't read it.

Gandalf:
There are few who can. The language is that of Mordor, which I will not utter here.

Frodo:
Mordor?

Gandalf:
In the common tongue it says, One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all, and in the darkness bind them.

Gandalf:
This is the One Ring, forged by the Dark Lord Sauron, in the fires of Mount Doom, taken by Isildur from the hand of Sauron himself.

Frodo:
Bilbo found it... in Gollum's cave.

Gandalf:
Yes. For 60 years, the Ring lay quiet in Bilbo's keeping, prolonging his life, delaying old age. But no longer, Frodo. Evil is stirring in Mordor. The Ring has awoken. It's heard its Master's call.

Frodo:
But he was destroyed. Sauron was destroyed!

[The Ring whispers]

Gandalf:
No, Frodo. The spirit of Sauron endured. His life-force is bound to the Ring, and the Ring survived. Sauron has returned. His Orcs have multiplied; his fortress of Barad-dÃ»r is rebuilt in the land of Mordor. Sauron needs only this Ring to cover all the lands in a second darkness. He is seeking it. Seeking it, all his thought is bent on it, and the Ring yearns above all else to reurn the hand of its Master. They are one, the Ring and the Dark Lord. Frodo... he must never find it.

Frodo:
All right. We put it away. We keep it hidden; we never speak of it again. No one knows it's here do they? Do they, Gandalf?

Gandalf:
There is one other who knew Bilbo had the Ring. I looked everywhere for the creature Gollum, but the enemy found him first. I don't know how long they tortured him, but admist the endless screams and inane babble, they discerned two words.

Frodo:
Shire? Baggins? But that will lead them here! Take it, Gandalf! Take it!

Gandalf:
No, Frodo.

Frodo:
You must take it!

Gandalf:
You cannot offer me this Ring!

Frodo:
I'm giving it to you!

Gandalf:
Don't... tempt me, Frodo! I dare not take it. Not even to keep it safe. Understand, Frodo, I would use this Ring from the desire to do good. But through me, it would wield a power too great and terrible to imagine.

Frodo:
But it cannot stay in the Shire!

Gandalf:
No! No, it can't.

Frodo:
[pause, then realizes his burden, gripping the Ring] What must I do?

[Gandalf finds Sam spying on him and Frodo]

Gandalf:
CONFOUND IT ALL, SAMWISE GAMGEE! Have you been eavesdropping?!

Sam:
I ain't been droppin' no eaves sir, honest. I was just cutting the grass under the window there, if you'll follow me.

Gandalf:
A little late for trimming the verge, don't you think?

Sam:
I heard raised voices-

Gandalf:
What did you hear?! Speak!

Sam:
N-nothing important! That is, I heard a good deal about a Ring and Dark Lord and something about the end of the world, but... Please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don't hurt me. Don't turn me into anything... unnatural.

Gandalf:
[smiles at Frodo] No... perhaps not. I've thought of a better use for you.

[Later, as Frodo and Gandalf leave the Shire]

Gandalf:
Come along, Samwise, keep up! [Sam follows them, struggling with all the luggage]

Sam:
This is it.

Frodo:
What?

Sam:
If I take one more step, I'll be the farthest away from home I've ever been.

Frodo:
Come on, Sam. Remember what Bilbo used to say: It's a dangerous business, Frodo, going out your door. You step onto the road, and if you don't keep your feet, there's no telling where you might be swept off to.

Saruman:
Sauron has regained much of his former strength. He cannot yet take physical form, but his spirit has lost none of its potency. Concealed within his fortress, the Lord of Mordor sees all. His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth, and flesh. You know of what I speak, Gandalf. A Great Eye, lidless, wreathed in flame.

Gandalf:
The Eye of Sauron.

Saruman:
He is gathering all evil to him. Very soon, he will have summoned an army great enough to launch an assault upon Middle Earth.

Gandalf:
You know this? How?

Saruman:
I have seen it.

Gandalf:
A PalantÃ­r is a dangerous tool, Saruman.

Saruman:
Why? Why should we fear to use it? [uncovers the PalantÃ­r he keeps]

Gandalf:
They are not all accounted for, the lost Seeing Stones. We do not know who else may be watching. [recovers the PalantÃ­r; the Eye of Sauron is shown to be agitated by this]

Saruman:
The hour is later is later than you think. Sauron's forces are already moving. The Nine have left Minas Morgul.

Gandalf:
The Nine?

Saruman:
They crossed the River Isen on Midsummer's Eve, disguised as riders in black.

Gandalf:
[Shocked] They've reached the Shire?!

Saruman:
They will find the Ring... and kill the one who carries it.

Gandalf:
Frodo!

[He moves towards the the doors, but Saruman seals them all]

Saruman:
You did not seriously think that a Hobbit could contend with the will of Sauron? There are none who can. Against the power of Mordor, there can be no victory. We must join with him, Gandalf. We must join with Sauron. It would be wise, my friend.

Gandalf:
[Disgusted] Tell me, friend... when did Saruman the Wise abandon reason for madness?!

[Angered, Saruman uses his powers to throw Gandalf to the floor. The two fight, but Saruman gains the upper hand]

Saruman:
I gave you the choice of aiding me willingly! But you have elected the way of pain!

[Strider has ushered Frodo into his room]

Strider:
You draw far too much attention to yourself, Mr. Underhill.

Frodo:
What do you want?

Strider:
More caution from you. That is no mere trinket you carry.

Frodo:
I carry nothing.

Strider:
Indeed. I can avoid being seen if I wish, but to disappear entirely; that is a rare gift.

Frodo:
Who are you?

Strider:
Are you frightened?

Frodo:
Yes.

Strider:
Not nearly frightened enough. I know what hunts you. [Strider spins round and draws his sword as Sam, Merry and Pippin storm in]

Sam:
Let him go! Or I'll have you, longshanks!

Strider:
You have a stout heart, little Hobbit, but that will not save you. You can no longer wait for the wizard, Frodo. They are coming.

Frodo:
[overhearing the Black Riders] What are they?

Strider:
They were once Men. Great Kings of Men. Then Sauron the Deceiver gave to them nine Rings of Power. Blinded by their greed, they took them without question, one by one falling to darkness. Now they are slaves to his will. They are the NazgÃ»l, Ringwraiths, neither living nor dead. At all times they feel the presence of the Ring, drawn to the power of the One. They will never stop hunting you.

Strider:
Gentlemen, we do not stop till nightfall.

Pippin:
What about breakfast?

Strider:
You already had it.

Pippin:
We had one, yes. What about second breakfast?

[Strider walks away]

Merry:
I don't think he knows about second breakfast, Pip.

Pippin:
What about elevenses? Luncheon? Afternoon tea? Dinner? Supper? He knows about them, doesn't he?

Merry:
I wouldn't count on it.

[Strider tosses them apples]

Arwen:
[in Elvish, to the wounded Frodo] Frodo. I am Arwen. I've come to help you. Hear my voice. Come back to the light.

Merry:
Who is she?

Arwen:
[kneeling down by Frodo] Frodo...

Sam:
She's an Elf.

[Arwen and Aragorn inspect Frodo's wound]

Arwen:
He's fading. He's not going to last. We must get him to my father. [Aragorn carries Frodo towards Arwen's horse Asfaloth] I've been looking for you for two days.

Merry:
Where are you taking him?

Arwen:
There are five Wraiths behind you. Where the other four are, I do not know.

Strider:
[Elvish] Stay with the hobbits. I'll send horses for you.

Arwen:
[Elvish] I'm the faster rider, I'll take him.

Strider:
[Elvish] The road is too dangerous.

Pippin:
What are they saying?

Arwen:
[Elvish] Frodo is dying. If I can get across the river, the power of my people will protect him. [common tongue] I do not fear them.

Strider:
[Elvish] As you wish. [common tongue] Arwen, ride hard. Don't look back.

Arwen:
[Elvish] Run fast, Asfaloth! Run fast! [she rides away with Frodo]

Sam:
What are you doing?! Those Wraiths are still out there!

Ringwraith:
Give up the Halfling, She-Elf!

Arwen:
[Draws her sword] If you want him, come and claim him!

Saruman:
The friendship of Saruman is not lightly turned aside. One ill turn deserves another. It is over. Embrace the power of the Ring... or embrace your own destruction!

[Gandalf has noticed Gwaihir, the Great Eagle, approaching]

Gandalf:
There is only one Lord of the Ring. Only one who can bend it to his will. And he does not share power! [jumps onto the Eagle's back and escapes]

Saruman:
[watching them fly off] So you have chosen death.

Frodo:
[reading Bilbo's book] There and Back Again: A Hobbits Tale by Bilbo Baggins. This is wonderful.

Bilbo:
I meant to go back. Wander the paths of Mirkwood, visit Laketown, see the Lonely Mountain again. But age it seems has finally caught up with me

Frodo:
[looks at a map of the Shire] I miss the Shire. I spent all my childhood pretending I was off somewhere else. Off with you on one of your adventures. My own adventure turned out to be quite different. I'm not like you, Bilbo.

Bilbo:
My dear boy...

Elrond:
[watching Frodo] His strength returns.

Gandalf:
That wound will never fully heal. He will carry it the rest of his life.

Elrond:
And yet, to have come so far still bearing the Ring, the Hobbit has shown extraordinary resiliance to its evil.

Gandalf:
It is a burden he should never have had to bear. We can ask no more of Frodo.

Elrond:
Gandalf, the enemy is moving. Sauron's forces are massing in the East; his Eye is fixed on Rivendell. And Saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us. Our list of allies grows thin!

Gandalf:
His treachery runs deeper than you know. With foul craft, Saruman has crossed Orcs with Goblin-Men. He's breeding an army in the caverns of Isengard. An army that can move in sunlight, and cover great distance at speed. Saruman is coming for the Ring.

Elrond:
This evil cannot be concealed by the power of the Elves. We do not have the strength to fight both Mordor and Isengard! Gandalf, the Ring cannot stay here. This peril belongs to all Middle Earth. They must decide now how to end it. The time of the Elves is over. My people are leaving these shores. Who will you look to when we've gone? The Dwarves? They hide in their mountains, seeking riches. They care nothing for the troubles of others.

Gandalf:
It is in Men that we must place our hope.

Elrond:
[bitterly] Men? Men are weak. The race of Men is failing. The Blood of NÃºmenor is all but spent, its pride and dignity forgotten. It is because of Men the Ring survives. I was there, Gandalf. I was there three thousand years ago, when Isildur took the Ring. I was there the day the strength of Men failed. I led Isildur into the heart of Mount Doom, where the Ring was forged - the one place it could be destroyed. It should have ended that day, but evil was allowed to endure. Isildur kept the Ring. The line of Kings was broken. There's no strength left in the World of Men. They're scattered, divided, leaderless.

Gandalf:
There is one who could unite them. One who could reclaim the Throne of Gondor.

Elrond:
He turned from that path a long time ago. He has chosen exile.

Boromir:
You are no elf?

Aragorn:
Men of the South are welcome here.

Boromir:
Who are you?

Aragorn:
I'm a friend of Gandalf the Grey.

Boromir:
Then we are here on a common purpose... friend.

Arwen:
[Elvish] Do you remember when we first met?

Aragorn:
[Elvish] I thought I had wandered into a dream.

Arwen:
[Elvish] Long years have passed. You did not have the cares you carry now. Do you remember what I told you?

Aragorn:
You said you'd bind yourself to me, forsaking the immortal life of your people.

Arwen:
And to that I hold. I would rather share one lifetime with you than face all the ages of this world alone. [hands him her pendant] I choose a mortal life.

Aragorn:
You cannot give me this!

Arwen:
It is mine to give to whom I will. Like my heart.

[At the Council of Elrond]

Elrond:
Strangers from distant lands, friends of old, you have been summoned here to answer the threat of Mordor. Middle Earth stands upon the brink of destruction; none can escape it. You will unite or you will fall. Each race is bound to this fate, this one doom. Bring forth the Ring, Frodo.

[Frodo puts the Ring on a stand for all to see]

Boromir:
So it is true. [Stands and walks towards the Ring] In a dream, I saw the Eastern sky grow dark. But in the West, a pale light lingered. A voice was crying, The doom is near at hand, Isildur's Bane is found. [Reaches for the Ring] Isildur's Bane...

Elrond:
Boromir!

Gandalf:
[Speaking the words engraved on the Ring] Ash nazg durbatulÃ»k, ash nazg gimbatul, ash nazg thrakatulÃ»k, agh burzum-ishi krimpatul!

[The light darkens and the air rumbles; Boromir backs away from the Ring]

Elrond:
Never before has anyone dared utter words of that tongue here, in Imladris.

Gandalf:
I do not ask for pardon, Master Elrond, for the Black Speech of Mordor may yet be heard in every corner of the West! The Ring is altogether evil.

Boromir:
But it is a gift. A gift to the foes of Mordor. Why not use this Ring? Long has my father, the Steward of Gondor, kept the forces of Mordor at bay. By the blood of our people are your lands kept safe! Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy! Let us use it against him!

Strider:
You cannot wield it. None of us can. The One Ring answers to Sauron alone. It has no other master.

Boromir:
And what would a Ranger know of this matter?

Legolas:
This is no mere Ranger. He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn. You owe him your allegiance.

Boromir:
Aragorn? This is Isildur's heir?

Legolas:
And heir to the throne of Gondor.

Strider:
[in Elvish] Sit down, Legolas.

Boromir:
Gondor has no King. Gondor needs no King.

Gandalf:
Aragorn is right. We cannot use it.

Elrond:
You have only one choice. The Ring must be destroyed.

Gimli:
Then what are we waiting for?

[He roars and strikes the Ring with his axe; the axe breaks, leaving the Ring perfectly intact]

Elrond:
The Ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son of Gloin, by any craft that we here possess. The Ring was made in the fires of Mount Doom. Only there can it be unmade. It must be taken deep into Mordor and cast back into the fiery chasm from whence it came! One of you... must do this.

Boromir:
One does not simply walk into Mordor. Its black gates are guarded by more than just Orcs. There is evil there that does not sleep. The Great Eye is ever watchful. It is a barren wasteland, riddled with fire, ash, and dust. The very air you breathe is a poisonous fume. Not with ten thousand men could you do this. It is folly!

Legolas:
Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has said? The Ring must be destroyed!

Gimli:
And I suppose you think you're the one to do it?!

Boromir:
And if we fail, what then?! What happens when Sauron takes back what is his?!

Gimli:
I will be dead before I see the Ring in the hands of an Elf! [The council argue amongst themselves] Never trust an Elf!

Gandalf:
Do you not understand?! While you bicker amongst yourselves, Sauron's power grows! None will escape it! You'll all be destroyed!

[As Frodo focuses on the Ring, everyone's arguing voices are drowned out by Sauron's voice reciting the Ring's inscription. Frodo gets to his feet]

Frodo:
I will take it! [All continue to argue] I will take it! [All fall silent] I will take the Ring to Mordor. Though... I do not know the way.

Gandalf:
I will help you bear this burden, Frodo Baggins, for as long as it is yours to bear.

Aragorn:
If by my life or death I can protect you, I will. You have my sword...

Legolas:
And you have my bow.

Gimli:
And my axe.

Boromir:
You carry the fate of us all, little one. If this is indeed the will of the Council, then Gondor will see it done.

[Sam rushes in]

Sam:
Hey! Mr. Frodo's not going anywhere without me!

Elrond:
No, indeed. It is hardly possible to separate you, even when he is summoned to a secret council and you are not.

Merry:
We're coming, too! [Elrond looks astounded] You'd have to send us home tied up in a sack to stop us!

Pippin:
Anyway, you need people of intelligence on this sort of mission... quest... thing.

Merry:
That rules you out, Pippin.

Elrond:
Nine companions. So be it. You shall be the Fellowship of the Ring.

Pippin:
Great! Where are we going?

Gandalf:
Frodo, come and help an old man. How's your shoulder?

Frodo:
Better than it was.

Gandalf:
And the Ring? You feel its power growing, don't you? I've felt it too. You must be careful now. Evil will be drawn to you from outside the Fellowship... and, I fear, from within.

Frodo:
Who then, do I trust?

Gandalf:
You must trust yourself. Trust your own strengths.

Frodo:
What do you mean?

Gandalf:
There are many powers in this world, for good or for evil. Some are greater than I am. And against some, I have not yet been tested.

[Gandalf has tried to open the Doors of Durin, to no avail]

Gandalf:
I once knew every spell in all the tongues of Elves, Men, and Orcs.

Pippin:
What are you going to do, then?

Gandalf:
Knock your head against these doors, Peregrin Took! And if that does not shatter them, and I am allowed a little peace from foolish questions, I will try to find the opening words.

Frodo:
There's something down there!

Gandalf:
It's Gollum.

Frodo:
Gollum?

Gandalf:
He's been following us for three days.

Frodo:
He escaped the dungeons of Barad-dÃ»r?

Gandalf:
Escaped... or was set loose. Now the Ring has drawn him here. He hates and loves the Ring, as he hates and loves himself. He will never be rid of his need for it. SmÃ©agol's life is a sad story. Yes, SmÃ©agol he was once called... before the Ring found him. Before it drove him mad.

Frodo:
It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him when he had the chance.

Gandalf:
Pity? It was pity that stayed Bilbo's hand. Many that die deserve life, and some that live deserve death. Can you give it to them, Frodo? Do not be too eager to deal out death in judgment. Even the very wise cannot see all ends. My heart tells me that Gollum has some part to play, for good or ill, before this is over. The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many.

Frodo:
I wish the Ring had never come to me. I wish none of this had happened.

Gandalf:
So do all who live to see such times; but that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us. There are other forces at work in this world, Frodo, besides the will of evil. Bilbo was meant to find the Ring. In which case, you were also meant to have it. And that is an encouraging thought.

Boromir:
What is this new devilry?

Gandalf:
A Balrog... a demon of the Ancient World. This foe is beyond any of you. RUN!

Gimli:
Be cautious, young Hobbits. They say a great sorceress lives in these woods. An Elf witch of terrible power. All who look upon her fall under her spell...

Galadriel:
[in Frodo's mind] Frodo.

Gimli:
...and are never seen again.

Galadriel:
[to Frodo] Your coming to us is as the footsteps of doom. You bring great evil here, Ringbearer.

Sam:
Mr. Frodo?

Gimli:
Well, here's one Dwarf she won't ensnare so easily. I have the eyes of a hawk and the ears of a fox!

[Haldir and a group of elves appear, holding Gimli and the others at arrow point]

Haldir:
The Dwarf breathes so loud, we could have shot him in the dark.

Celeborn:
Eight there are here, yet nine there were set out from Rivendell. Tell me, where is Gandalf? For I much desire to speak with him.

Galadriel:
He has fallen into shadow. The Quest stands upon the edge of knife. Stray but a little and it will fail, to the ruin of all. Yet hope remains while the company is true. Do not let your hearts be troubled. Go now and rest for you are weary with sorrow and much toil. Tonight you will sleep in peace. [to Frodo, telepathically] Welcome, Frodo of the Shire... one who has seen THE EYE!

Aragorn:
Take some rest. These borders are well protected.

Boromir:
I will find no rest here. I heard her voice inside my head. She spoke of my father and the fall of Gondor, and she said to me: Even now, there is hope left. But I cannot see it. It is long since we had any hope. My father is a noble man, but his rule is failing and our... our people lose faith. He looks to me to make things right and I would do it, I would see the glory of Gondor restored. Have you ever seen it, Aragorn? The White Tower of Ecthelion, glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver. Its banners caught high in the morning breeze. Have you ever been called home by the clear ringing of silver trumpets?

Aragorn:
I have seen the white city... long ago.

Boromir:
One day our paths will lead us there, and the tower guards shall take up the call: The Lords of Gondor have returned!

Galadriel:
Will you look into the mirror?

Frodo:
What will I see?

Galadriel:
Even the wisest cannot tell. For the mirror shows many things. Things that were, things that are, and some things... that have not yet come to pass.

[Looking into the mirror, Frodo sees the Orcs enslave the Hobbits and reduce the Shire to an industrial wasteland; finally, the Eye of Sauron causes him to stumble backwards]

Galadriel:
I know what it is you saw; for it is also in my mind. [in Frodo's mind] It is what will come to pass if you should fail. The Fellowship is breaking. It is already begun. He will try to take the Ring. You know of whom I speak. One by one, it will destroy them all.

Frodo:
If you ask it of me, I will give you the One Ring. [holds out the Ring to Galadriel]

Galadriel:
You offer it to me freely? I do not deny that my heart has greatly desired this... [Suddenly fierce] In place of a Dark Lord, you would have a Queen! Not dark, but beautiful and terrible as the Dawn! Treacherous as the Sea! Stronger than the foundations of the Earth! All shall love me and despair! [Stops, shaken, and becomes calm again] I pass the test. I will diminish, and go into the West... and remain Galadriel.

Frodo:
I cannot do this alone.

Galadriel:
You are a Ringbearer, Frodo. To bear a Ring of Power is to be alone. [holds up her hand to show a silver, flower-jeweled Ring] This is Nenya, the Ring of Adamant, and I am its keeper. This task was appointed to you and if you do not find a way, no one will.

Frodo:
I know what I must do, it's just that... I'm afraid to do it.

Galadriel:
Even the smallest person can change the course of the future.

Saruman:
Do you know how the Orcs first came into being? They were Elves once. Taken by the Dark Powers. Tortured, and mutilated. A ruined and terrible form of life. And now... perfected. My fighting Uruk-hai. Whom do you serve?

Lurtz:
Saruman!

Boromir:
[carrying gathered wood] None of us should wander alone, you least of all. So much depends on you. [Frodo is silent] Frodo? I know why you seek solitude. You suffer. I see it day by day. You're sure you do not suffer needlessly? There are other ways, Frodo. Other paths that we might take.

Frodo:
I know what you would say. And it would seem like wisdom, but for the warning in my heart.

Boromir:
Warning? Against what? We're all afraid, Frodo, but to let that fear drive us to destroy what hope we have, don't you see that is madness?

Frodo:
There is no other way.

Boromir:
[frustrated] I ask only for the strength to defend my people! [throws down the wood] If you would but lend me the Ring...

Frodo:
No!

Boromir:
Why do you recoil? I am no thief.

Frodo:
You are not yourself.

Boromir:
What chance do you think you have? They will find you. They will take the Ring. And you will beg for death before the end! [Frodo tries to walk away] You fool! It is not yours, save by unhappy chance! It could have been mine! It should be mine! [pins Frodo to the ground] Give it to me! GIVE IT TO ME!

Frodo:
No! [puts the Ring on his finger and slips away, invisible]

Boromir:
I see your mind. You will take the Ring to Sauron! You will betray us! You go to your death, and the death of us all! Curse you! Curse you, and all the Halflings! [suddenly gets ahold of himself] Frodo? Frodo. What have I done? Please, Frodo. Frodo, I'm sorry! Frodo!

Aragorn:
Frodo?

Frodo:
It has taken Boromir.

Aragorn:
Where is the Ring?

Frodo:
Stay away! [Frodo bolts, and Aragorn follows him]

Aragorn:
[confused] Frodo! I swore to protect you.

Frodo:
Can you protect me from yourself? [holds out the Ring] Would you destroy it?

[Aragorn reaches out for the Ring, hearing Sauron's voice whisper to him. He pushes Frodo's hand away]

Aragorn:
I would have gone with you to the end. Into the very fires of Mordor.

Frodo:
I know. Look after the others. Especially Sam. He will not understand.

Boromir:
[dying] They took the little ones.

Aragorn:
Be still.

Boromir:
Frodo... Where is Frodo?

Aragorn:
I let Frodo go.

Boromir:
Then you did what I could not. I tried to take the Ring from him.

Aragorn:
The Ring is beyond our reach now.

Boromir:
Forgive me. I could not see it. I have failed you.

Aragorn:
No, Boromir. You fought bravely. You kept your honor. [tires to remove an arrow from Boromir]

Boromir:
Leave it. It is over. The world of men shall fall. All will come to darkness. My city will ruin.

Aragorn:
I do not know what strength is in my blood, but I swear to you I will not let the Great City fall. Nor our people fail.

Boromir:
Our people... I would have followed you, my brother... my captain... my king. [dies]

Aragorn:
Be at peace, Son of Gondor. [kisses Boromir's head] They will look for his coming from the white tower, but he will not return.

Frodo:
Go back, Sam! I'm going to Mordor alone.

Sam:
Of course you are. And I'm coming with you!

[Sam wades in the water]

Frodo:
You can't swim! Sam! [Sam sinks below the surface] SAM!

[Sam nearly drowns, but Frodo pulls him up into the raft]

Sam:
I made a promise, Mr. Frodo. A promise! Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee. And I don't mean to! I don't mean to.

Legolas:
Hurry! Frodo and Sam have reached the eastern shore.

[Aragorn does not move]

Legolas:
You mean not to follow them.

Aragorn:
Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

Gimli:
Then it has all been in vain. The Fellowship has failed.

Aragorn:
Not if we hold true to each other. We will not abandon Merry and Pippin to torment and death. Not while we have strength left. Leave all that can be spared behind. We travel light. Let's hunt some Orc!

Gimli:
Yes!

[Last lines]

Frodo:
Mordor... I hope the others find a safer road.

Sam:
Strider'll look after 'em.

Frodo:
I don't suppose we'll ever see them again.

Sam:
We may yet, Mr Frodo. We may.

Frodo:
Sam... I'm glad you're with me.

One Ring to rule them all.

The Legend Comes to Life

One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all, and in the darkness bind them.

Fate Has Chosen Him. A Fellowship Will Protect Him. Evil Will Hunt Them.

Middle-earth comes to life...

Even the smallest person can change the course of the future.

All you have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to you.

Power can be held in the smallest of things...

Its power corrupts all who desire it. Only one has the will to resist it. A Fellowship of Nine must destroy it.

[Gandalf arrives at Bag End, goes through the gate, and knocks on the door with his staff]

Bilbo:
[from inside] No thank you! We don't want any more visitors, well-wishers, or distant relations!

Gandalf:
And what about very old friends?

[Bilbo opens the door]

Bilbo:
Gandalf?

Gandalf:
Bilbo Baggins.

Bilbo:
My dear Gandalf! [hugs Gandalf]

Gandalf:
It's good to see you. One hundred and eleven years old; who would believe it? You haven't aged a day. [they both laugh]

Bilbo:
Come on, come in! Welcome, welcome.

Boromir:
The Shards of Narsil. [picks up hiltpiece]. The blade that cut the ring from Sauron's hand. [cuts himself with the sword]. It's still sharp. [looks at Aragorn] But nothing less than a broken heirloom. [drops hiltpiece in an almost-disrespectful manner].

Boromir:
You are no elf?

Aragorn:
Men of the South are welcome here.

Boromir:
Who are you?

Aragorn:
I'm a friend of Gandalf the Grey.

Boromir:
Then we are here on a common purpose... friend.

[Boromir examines the shards of Narsil]

Boromir:
The shards of Narsil. [picks up hiltpiece] The blade that cut the ring from Sauron's hand. [cuts himself with the sword] It's still sharp. [looks at Aragorn] But no more than a broken heirloom. [drops hiltpiece in an almost-disrespectful manner]

It's no bad thing to celebrate a simple life.


Gandalf the White:
The Grey Pilgrim, that's what they used to call me. Three hundred lives of men I've walked this earth and now I have no time. With luck, my search will not be in vain. Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day. At dawn, look to the East.

Gandalf the White:
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift. The battle for Helm's Deep is over. The battle for Middle Earth is about to begin. All our hopes now lie with two little hobbits, somewhere in the wilderness.

Saruman the White:
The world is changing. Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard and Mordor? To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman and the union of the two towers? Together, Lord Sauron, we shall rule this Middle-Earth. The old world will burn in the fires of industry. The forests will fall. A new order will rise. We will drive the machinery of war with the sword and the spear and the iron fist of the Orc. We have only to remove those who oppose us.

Saruman the White:
[Addressing his Uruk-Hai army] A new power is rising! Its victory...is at hand! This night, the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan! March to Helm's Deep! Leave none alive! TO WAR! There will be no dawn... for Men!

Galadriel:
The power of the enemy is growing. Sauron will use his puppet Saruman to destroy the people of Rohan. Isengard has been unleashed. The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor, the last free kingdom of Men. His war on this country will come swiftly. He senses the Ring is close. The strength of the Ringbearer is failing. In his heart, Frodo begins to understand. The quest will claim his life. You know this. You have foreseen it. It is the risk we all took. In the gathering dark, the will of the Ring grows strong. It works hard now to find its way back into the hands of men. Men, who are so easily seduced by its power. The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hands, take the Ring for his own and the world will fall. It is close now, so close to achieving its goal. For Sauron will have dominion of all life on this Earth, even unto the ending of the world. The time of the Elves is over. Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate? Do we let them stand alone?

ThÃ©oden:
I have not seen my niece smile for a long time. She was a girl when they brought her father back dead, cut down by Orcs. She watched her mother succumb to grief, and she was left alone to tend her king in growing fear, doomed to wait upon an old man who should have loved her as a father.

ThÃ©oden:
So it begins.

Aragorn:
Legolas, what do your Elf-eyes see?

Sam:
[to Faramir] Do you want to know what happened to Boromir? You want to know why your brother died? He tried to take the Ring from Frodo! After swearing an oath to protect him, he tried to kill him! The Ring drove your brother mad!

Sam It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo, the ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger they were, and sometimes you didn't want to know the end because how could the end be happy? How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened? But in the end, it's only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come, and when the sun shines, it'll shine out the clearer. Those were the stories that stayed with you, that meant something even if you were too small to understand why. But I think Mr. Frodo, I do understand, I know now. Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't. They kept going because they were holding on to somethingâ€¦. That there's some good in the world, Mr. Frodo, and it's worth fighting for.

UglÃºk:
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys!

Sam:
Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth we don't want to see any closer, and the one place we're trying to get to. It's just where we can't get. Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost. I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.

Frodo:
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam... but they did.

Gollum:
[Sam has him tethered with the Elven rope] IT BURNS! IT BURNS US! It freezes! Nasty Elves twisted it. TAKE IT OFF US!

Sam:
Quiet, you! [to Frodo] It's hopeless! Every Orc in Mordor's gonna hear this racket! Let's just tie him up and leave him.

Gollum:
NO! That would kill us! Kill us! [groans and writhes on the rocks]

Sam:
It's no more than you deserve!

Frodo:
Maybe he does deserve to die. But now that I see him, I do pity him.

Gollum:
[gets up, trying to be polite] We be nice to them, if they be nice to us. Take it off us! We swears to do what you wants! We swears...

Frodo:
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.

Gollum:
We swears to serve the master of the precious. We'll swear on... on the precious! Gollum, gollum.

Frodo:
The Ring is treacherous. It will hold you to your word.

Gollum:
Yes... on the precious. On the precious.

Sam:
[brief silence] I DON'T BELIEVE YOU! [Gollum tries to flee, but Sam pulls him back by the rope] Get down! I said DOWN!

Frodo:
Sam!

Sam:
He's trying to trick us! If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep!

[Gollum gasps, clutching at the rope around his neck; Frodo approaches him]

Frodo:
You know the way into Mordor?

Gollum:
[afraid] Yes...

Frodo:
You've been there before?

Gollum:
Yes...

Frodo:
[removes the rope] You will lead us to the Black Gate.

Legolas:
Come, Gimli! We're gaining on them!

Gimli:
I'm wasted on cross-country! We dwarves are natural sprinters! Very dangerous over short distances!

Ã‰owyn:
Your son is badly wounded, my lord. Will you not go to him? Uncle?

Ã‰omer:
He was ambushed by Orcs. If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.

GrÃ­ma Wormtongue:
That is a lie. Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.

ThÃ©oden:
GrÃ­ma... GrÃ­ma...

Ã‰omer:
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands. Unchecked, unchallenged, killing at will. Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman. [tosses an Orc helmet at ThÃ©oden's feet]

GrÃ­ma Wormtongue:
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind? Can you not see your uncle is wearied by your malcontent? Your warmongering?

Ã‰omer:
Warmongering? [grabs GrÃ­ma by the throat] How long is it since Saruman bought you? What was the promised price, GrÃ­ma? When all the Men are dead, you'll take your share of the treasure? Too long have you watched my sister. Too long have you haunted her steps.

[Guards seize Ã‰omer from behind]

GrÃ­ma Wormtongue:
You see much, Ã‰omer, son of Ã‰omund. Too much. [guards begin to drag Ã‰omer out] You are here forth banished from the Kingdom of Rohan and all its domains, under pain of death.

Ã‰omer:
You have no authority here! Your orders mean nothing!

GrÃ­ma Wormtongue:
This order does not come from me. It comes from the King. [holds up a sealed decree] He signed it this morning.

Orc Captain:
I'm starving! We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days!

Snaga:
Yeah! Why can't we have some meat? [staring at Merry and Pippin] What about them? They're fresh.

UglÃºk:
They are not for eating!

GrishnÃ¡kh:
What about their legs? They don't need those. Ooh, they look tasty...!

UglÃºk:
[pushing GrishnÃ¡kh away] Get back, scum! The prisoners go to Saruman, alive and unspoiled!

GrishnÃ¡kh:
Alive? Why alive? Do they give good sport?

UglÃºk:
They have something. An Elvish weapon. The Master wants it for the War.

Pippin Took:
[whispering to Merry] They think we have the Ring.

Merry Brandybuck:
Shh! As soon as they find out we don't, we're dead.

Snaga:
[approaching the Hobbits with a blade] Carve them up! Just a mouthful! A bit off the flank!

UglÃºk:
No! [decapitates Snaga] Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys!

Ã‰omer:
What business does an Elf, a Man, and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark? Speak quickly!

Gimli:
Give me your name, Horse-master, and I shall give you mine.

Ã‰omer:
[gets off horse] I would cut off your head, Dwarf, if it stood but a little higher from the ground.

Legolas:
[quickly draws his bow] You would die before your stroke fell!

[Rohirrim point spears at Legolas, Aragorn signals for Legolas to bring down his weapon]

Aragorn:
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn. This is Gimli, son of GlÃ³in, and Legolas of the Woodland Realm. We are friends of Rohan, and of ThÃ©oden, your King.

Ã‰omer:
ThÃ©oden no longer recognizes friend from foe. Not even his own kin. Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claimed lordship over these lands. My company are those loyal to Rohan, and for that we are banished. The White Wizard is cunning. He walks here and there they say, as an old man hooded and cloaked. And everywhere his spies slip past our nets.

Aragorn:
We are no spies. We track a party of Uruk-Hai, Westward across the plain. They have taken two of our friends captive.

Ã‰omer:
The Uruks are destroyed. We slaughtered them during the night.

Gimli:
But there were two Hobbits! Did you see two Hobbits with 'em?

Aragorn:
They would be small. Only children to your eyes.

Ã‰omer:
We left none alive. We piled the carcasses and burned them.

Gimli:
Dead?

Ã‰omer:
I am sorry. [whistles] Hasufel! Arod! [two riderless horses approach] May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters. Farewell. Look for your friends. But do not trust to hope. It has forsaken these lands... We ride North!

Treebeard:
Little Orcs! Bru-rah-rhum!

Pippin Took:
It's talking, Merry! The tree is talking!

Treebeard:
Tree?! I am no tree! I am an Ent.

Merry Brandybuck:
A tree-herder. A Shepherd of the forest!

Pippin Took:
Don't talk to it, Merry! Don't encourage it!

Treebeard:
Treebeard, some call me.

Pippin Took:
And, whose side are you on?

Treebeard:
Side? I am on nobody's side, because nobody is on my side, little Orc. Nobody cares for the woods anymore.

Merry Brandybuck:
We're not Orcs! We're Hobbits!

Treebeard:
Hobbits? Mmm... never heard of a Hobbit before. Sounds like Orc mischief to me! They come with fire, they come with axes! Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning! Destroyers and usurpers! Curse them!

Merry Brandybuck:
No! You don't understand! We're Hobbits! Halflings! Shire-Folk!

Treebeard:
Maybe you are, and maybe you aren't. The White Wizard will know.

Sam:
It's a bog! He's lead us into a swamp!

Gollum:
Swamp, yes. Yes. Come master, we will take you on safe path through the mist. I found it, I did. A way through the mashes. Orcs don't use it. Orcs don't know it. They go around, for miles and miles! Come quickly. Soft and swift as shadows, we must be.

Sam:
There are dead things. Dead faces in the water!

Gollum:
All dead. All rotten. Elves, and Men, and Orcses. A great battle long ago... The Dead Marshes. Yes, yes, that is their name! This way. Don't follow the lights. [Sam slips and almost ends up in the water] Careful now! Or Hobbits go down to join the Dead Ones, and light little candles of their own.

Gollum:
[to himself] So bright... so beautiful... ahh, precious...

Frodo:
What did you say?

Gollum:
Master should be resting. Master needs to keep up his strength.

Frodo:
Who are you?

Gollum:
Mustn't ask us, not it's business. Gollum, gollum.

Frodo:
Gandalf told me you were one of the River-folk.

Gollum:
[ignoring him] Cold be heart and hand and bone. Cold be travelers far from home.

Frodo:
He said your life was a sad story.

Gollum:
They do not see what lies ahead, when Sun has faded and Moon is dead!

Frodo:
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once, were you... SmÃ©agol?

Gollum:
What... what did you call me?

Frodo:
That was your name once, wasn't it? A long time ago.

Gollum:
My name? My name... [smiles] SmÃ©agol.

White Wizard:
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.

Aragorn:
Where are they?

White Wizard:
They passed this way, the day before yesterday. They met someone they did not expect. Does that comfort you?

Aragorn:
Who are you? Show yourself! [the White Wizard reveals himself to be Gandalf] It cannot be!

Legolas:
Forgive me. I mistook you for Saruman.

Gandalf:
I am Saruman. Or rather, Saruman as he should have been.

Aragorn:
You fell.

Gandalf:
Through fire and water. From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak, I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth. Until at last, I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside. Darkness took me. And I strayed out of thought and time. Stars wheeled overhead and everyday was as long as a life-age of the earth. But it was not the end. I felt life in me again. I've been sent back until my task is done.

Aragorn:
Gandalf...

Gandalf:
Gandalf? Yes... that's what they used to call me. Gandalf the Grey. That was my name.

Gimli:
[surprised] Gandalf!

Gandalf:
I am Gandalf the White. And I come back to you now, at the turn of the tide. One stage of your journey is over, another begins. War has come to Rohan. We must ride to Edoras with all speed.

GrÃ­ma Wormtongue:
[finds Ã‰owyn crying over ThÃ©odred's body] Oh, he... he must have died sometime in the night. What a tragedy for the king to lose his only son and heir. I understand his passing is hard to accept, especially now that your brother has deserted you.

Ã‰owyn:
Leave me alone, snake!

GrÃ­ma Wormtongue:
Oh, but you are alone! Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness? In bitter watches of the night, when all your life seems to shrink, the walls of your bower closing in about you, like a hutch to trammel some wild thing in! [putting a hand to her cheek] So fair, so cold, like a morning of pale spring still clinging to winter's chill...

Ã‰owyn:
Your words are poison! [pulls away and leaves]

GrÃ­ma Wormtongue:
Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear! LÃ¡thspell I name you. Ill news is an ill guest.

Gandalf:
Be silent! Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth! I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm. [Points his staff at Grima]

GrÃ­ma Wormtongue:
[Terrified] The staff! [To guards] I TOLD YOU TO TAKE THE WIZARD'S STAFF!

[The guards attempt to restrain the group, and a fight breaks out; Gandalf approaches ThÃ©oden]

Gandalf:
ThÃ©oden! Son of Thengel! Too long have you sat in the shadows.

Gimli:
[Pinning down GrÃ­ma] I would stay still if I were you!

Gandalf:
[To ThÃ©oden] Harken to me! I release you from this spell... [Attempts to remove Saruman's influence, seemingly to no avail]

ThÃ©oden:
[Laughs cruelly] You have no power here, Gandalf the Grey! [Continues to laugh]

Gandalf the White:
[Removes his grey cloak, stunning ThÃ©oden with the white robe beneath] I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound!

Saruman:
[Speaking through ThÃ©oden] If I go... ThÃ©oden dies!

Gandalf the White:
[Casts a spell, knocking ThÃ©oden back] You did not kill me... you will not kill him!

Saruman:
[Speaking through ThÃ©oden] Rohan is mine!

Gandalf the White:
[Casts another spell] Begone! [ThÃ©oden lunges in anger, but Gandalf successfully casts Saruman's influence out. Slowly, he becomes himself again. Ã‰owyn rushes to his side.]

Ã‰owyn:
Uncle?

ThÃ©oden:
I... I recognize your face. Ã‰owyn. Gandalf?

Gandalf the White:
Breathe the free air again, my friend.

ThÃ©oden:
[stands up from the throne] Dark have been my dreams of late. [looks at his hands]

Gandalf the White:
Your fingers would remember their old strength better... if they grasped your sword.

[Grima's treachery is revealed and he is thrown out of the hall]

GrÃ­ma Wormtongue:
[pleading as he crawls away] I've only ever served you, My Lord!

ThÃ©oden:
[furious, advancing on GrÃ­ma with his sword in hand] Your leech-craft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!

GrÃ­ma Wormtongue:
[pleading] Send me not from your sight! [ThÃ©oden raises his sword to kill when Aragorn intervenes]

Aragorn:
No, my lord! No, my lord. Let him go. Enough blood has been spilled on his account.

ThÃ©oden:
SimbelmynÃ«. Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebears. Now it shall cover the grave of my son. Alas that these evil days should be mine. The young perish, and the old linger. That I should live to see the last days of my house.

Gandalf the White:
ThÃ©odred's death was not of your making.

ThÃ©oden:
No parent should have to bury their child. [begins to sob]

Gandalf the White:
He was strong in life. His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.

Samwise Gamgee:
[to Gollum] Hey, Stinker! Don't go getting too far ahead.

Frodo Baggins:
Why do you do that?

Samwise Gamgee:
What?

Frodo Baggins:
Call him names, run him down all the time.

Samwise Gamgee:
Because... because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo. There's naught left in him but lies and deceit. It's the Ring he wants; it's all he cares about.

Frodo Baggins:
You have no idea what it did to him. What it's still doing to him! I want to help him, Sam.

Samwise Gamgee:
Why?

Frodo Baggins:
Because I have to believe he can come back.

Samwise Gamgee:
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.

Frodo Baggins:
[angrily] What do you know about it?! Nothing! [instantly remorseful] I'm sorry, Sam. I don't know why I said that.

Samwise Gamgee:
I do. It's the Ring. You can't take your eyes off it. I've seen you. You're not eating; you barely sleep. It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo. You have to fight it!

Frodo Baggins:
[angry again] I know what I have to do, Sam. The Ring was entrusted to me! It's my task! Mine! My own!

Samwise Gamgee:
Can't you hear yourself? Don't you know who you sound like?!

Gollum:
We wants it, we needs it. Must have the precious. They stole it from us. Sneaky little hobbitses! Wicked, tricksy, false!

SmÃ©agol:
No. Not Master.

Gollum:
Yes, precious. False! They will cheat you, hurt you. Lie!

SmÃ©agol:
Master's my friend!

Gollum:
You don't have any friends! Nobody likes you!

SmÃ©agol:
Not listening... I'm not listening...

Gollum:
You're a liar. And a thief.

SmÃ©agol:
No.

Gollum:
[with relish] Murderer!

SmÃ©agol:
[miserable] Go away.

Gollum:
Go away? [laughs cruelly]

SmÃ©agol:
[begins to cry] I hate you. I hate you!

Gollum:
Where would you be without me?! Gollum! Gollum! I saved us! It was me. We survived because of me!

SmÃ©agol:
[stops crying] Not anymore.

Gollum:
[puzzled] What did you say?

SmÃ©agol:
Master looks after us now. We don't need you.

Gollum:
What?

SmÃ©agol:
Leave now, and never come back.

Gollum:
[hisses] No!

SmÃ©agol:
Leave now, and never come back! [Gollum snarls] LEAVE NOW, AND NEVER COME BACK! [Gollum is silent] We... we told him to go away. And away he goes, Precious! Gone, gone, gone! SmÃ©agol is free!

[Sam is cooking rabbits that Gollum caught]

SmÃ©agol:
What's it doing?! Stupid, fat hobbit! You ruins it!

Samwise Gamgee:
What's to ruin? There's hardly any meat on them. What we need is a few good taters.

SmÃ©agol:
What's taters, precious? What's taters, eh?

Samwise Gamgee:
Po-ta-toes! Boil em, mash em, stick 'em in a stew. Lovely big golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish. [SmÃ©agol spits in disgust] Even you couldn't say no to that.

SmÃ©agol:
Oh yes, we could! Spoiling nice fish! Give it to us raw, and wriggling! You keep nasty chips!

Samwise Gamgee:
You're hopeless.

[Frodo and Sam have just been captured by Faramir and his Ithilien Rangers]

Samwise Gamgee:
Wait! We're innocent travellers!

Faramir:
There are no travellers in these lands. Only servants of the Dark Tower.

Frodo Baggins:
We are bound to an errand of secrecy. Those who claim to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder us.

Faramir:
The enemy? [turns over the body of a fallen Haradrim soldier] His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem. You wonder what his name is. Where he came from. If he was really evil at heart. What lies or threats led him on this long march from home? And he'd not rather had stayed there, at peace. War will make corpses of us all.

Gimli:
[to Ã‰owyn] It's true you don't see many Dwarf women. In fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance, that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men.

Aragorn:
[whispers] It's the beards.

Gimli:
This in turn had lead to the belief that there are no women. And that Dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground! Which is of course ridiculous.

Ã‰owyn:
My uncle told me a strange thing. He said that you rode to war with Thengel, my grandfather. But he must be mistaken.

Aragorn:
King ThÃ©oden has a good memory. He was only a small child at the time.

Ã‰owyn:
Then you must be at least sixty. Seventy? But you cannot be eighty!

Aragorn:
Eighty-seven.

Ã‰owyn:
You are one of the DÃºnedain. A descendant of NÃºmenor, blessed with long life. It was said that your race had passed into legend.

Aragorn:
There are few of us left. The Northern Kingdom was destroyed long ago.

Elrond:
[in Elvish] Arwen, it is time. The ships are leaving for Valinor. Go now before it is too late.

Arwen:
I have made my choice.

Elrond:
He is not coming back. Why do you linger here when there is no hope?

Arwen:
There is still hope.

Elrond:
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted. If Sauron is defeated, and Aragorn made king and all that you hope for comes true, you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality. Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time, Aragorn will die. And there will be no comfort for you. No comfort to ease the pain of his passing. He will come to death, an image of the splendour of the kings of men in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world. But you, my daughter, you will linger on in darkness and in doubt, as nightfall in winter that comes without a star. Here you will dwell, bound to your grief, under the fading trees, until all the world is changed and the long years of your life are utterly spent. Arwen, there is nothing for you here... only death. [in Elvish] Do I not also have your love?

Arwen:
[in Elvish, crying] You have my love, father.

Faramir:
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.

Samwise Gamgee:
Spies?! Now wait just a minute!

Faramir:
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you? Speak!

Frodo Baggins:
We are Hobbits of the Shire. Frodo Baggins is my name and this is Samwise Gamgee.

Faramir:
Your bodyguard?

Samwise Gamgee:
His gardener.

Faramir:
And where is your skulking friend? That gangrel creature. He had an ill-favoured look.

Frodo Baggins:
[reluctant] There was no other. We set out from Rivendell with seven companions. One we lost in Moria. Two were my kin. A Dwarf there was also, and an Elf, and two Men: Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.

Faramir:
[solemn] You are a friend of Boromir?

Frodo Baggins:
Yes, for my part.

Faramir:
It would grieve you, then, to learn that he is dead.

Frodo Baggins:
[shocked] Dead?! How? When?

Faramir:
As one of his companions, I had hope you would tell me. He was my brother.

[Frodo has allowed Faramir to take Gollum prisoner]

Gollum:
SmÃ©agol... Why does he cry, SmÃ©agol?

SmÃ©agol:
[sobbing] Cruel men hurts us. Master tricksed us...

Gollum:
Of course he did! I told you he was tricksy. I told you he was false.

SmÃ©agol:
Master is our friend... our friend...

Gollum:
Master betrayed us!

SmÃ©agol:
No, not it's business! Leave us alone!

Gollum:
Filthy little hobbitses, they stole it from us!

SmÃ©agol:
No... No...

Faramir:
What did they steal?

Gollum:
My... PRECIOUSSS! [screams with rage]

Saruman:
Gandalf the White. Gandalf the Fool! Does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety?

GrÃ­ma Wormtongue:
There were three who followed the wizard. An Elf, a Dwarf, and a Man.

Saruman:
[sniffs] You stink of horse. [GrÃ­ma walks away] The Man, was he from Gondor?

GrÃ­ma Wormtongue:
[Saruman regains Grima's attention] No, from the North. One of the DÃºnedain Rangers, I thought he was. His cloth was poor. And yet, he bore a strange ring. Two serpents with emerald eyes, one devouring, the other one crowned with golden flowers.

Saruman:
The Ring of Barahir. So Gandalf Greyhame thinks he's found Isildur's heir? The lost king of Gondor? He is a fool. The line was broken years ago. It matters not. The World of Men shall fall. It will begin at Edoras.

[Camera slowly zooms in at the drainhole at Helm's Deep]

GrÃ­ma Wormtongue Helm's Deep has one weakness. It's outer wall is solid rock, but for a small culvert on its base, which is little more than a drain.

[Scene changes to Isengard, where Saruman is seen pouring gunpowder]

GrÃ­ma How? How can fire undo stone? What kind of device will bring down the wall?

[Saruman holds GrÃ­ma's hand back, which has a candle]

Saruman:
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.

GrÃ­ma:
Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning, thousands to storm the keep.

Saruman:
Tens of thousands.

GrÃ­ma:
But, my lord, there is no such force.

[Saruman walks GrÃ­ma outside as they are talking. At this point, Saruman reveals to GrÃ­ma the massive army]

Saruman:
A new power is rising! Its victory is at hand! [the Uruks cheer] This night, the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan! March to Helm's Deep! Leave none alive! To war! There will be no dawn...for Men!

ThÃ©oden:
A great host, you say?

Aragorn:
All Isengard is emptied.

ThÃ©oden:
How many?

Aragorn:
Ten thousand strong at least.

ThÃ©oden:
[astonished] Ten thousand?

Aragorn:
It is an army bred for a single purpose: to destroy the World of Men. They will be here by nightfall.

ThÃ©oden:
Let them come.

ThÃ©oden:
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock. Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn, we've seen it before. Crops can be resown. Homes rebuilt. Within these walls we will outlast them.

Aragorn:
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages; they come to destroy its people. Down to the last child.

ThÃ©oden:
[whispered] What would you have me do? Look at my men. Their courage hangs by a thread. If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance.

Aragorn:
Send out riders, my lord, you must call for aid.

ThÃ©oden:
And who will come? Elves? Dwarfs? We are not so lucky in our friends as you. The old alliances are dead.

Aragorn:
Gondor will answer.

ThÃ©oden:
[angrily] Gondor?! Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?! Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?! Where was Gon-? [suddenly regains hold of himself] No, my lord Aragorn. We are alone.

Aragorn:
Farmers, ferriers, stable boys. These are no soldiers.

Gimli:
Most have seen too many winters.

Legolas:
Or too few. Look at them. They're frightened. You can see it in their eyes. [in Elvish] And they should be. Three hundred... against ten thousand!

Aragorn:
[in Elvish] They have more hope of defending themselves here than at Edoras.

Legolas:
[in Elvish] Aragorn. They cannot win this fight. They are all going to die!

Aragorn:
[in common tongue] Then I shall die as one of them!

Gimli:
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.

Legolas:
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.

Gimli:
Let's hope they last the night.

Gimli:
[failing to see over the wall] What's happening out there?

Legolas:
Shall I describe it to you? Or would you like me to find you a box?

[Gimli is silent for a moment, then laughs]

Gimli:
[kills two Uruk-Hai warriors] Legolas! Two already!

Legolas:
I'm on seventeen!

Gimli:
Huh? I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me! [kills another one]

Legolas:
[shoots two more] Nineteen!

Treebeard:
We have just agreed... [falls asleep]

Merry Brandybuck:
Yes?

Treebeard:
[wakes up] I have told your names to the Entmoot and we have agreed... you are not Orcs. [smiles]

Pippin Took:
Well, that's good news.

Merry Brandybuck:
What about Saruman? Have you come to a decision about him?

Treebeard:
Now, don't be hasty, master Meriadoc...

Merry Brandybuck:
Hasty? Our friends are out there! They need our help! They cannot fight this war on their own!

Treebeard:
War, yes. It affects us all, tree, root and twig. But you must understand, young Hobbit, it takes a long time to say anything in Old Entish. And we never say anything unless it is worth taking a long time to say.

Gimli:
Oh, come on! We can take 'em!

Aragorn:
It's a long way.

Gimli:
[reluctantly] Toss me.

Aragorn:
What?

Gimli:
I cannot jump the distance, you'll have to toss me! [Aragorn nods] Don't tell the Elf.

Aragorn:
Not a word.

Treebeard:
The Ents cannot hold back this storm. We must weather such things as we have always always done.

Merry Brandybuck:
How can that be your decision?!

Treebeard:
This is not our war.

Merry Brandybuck:
But you're part of this world! Aren't you? You must help! Please! You must do something.

Treebeard:
You are young and brave, Master Merry. But your part in this tale is over. Go back to your home.

Pippin Took:
Maybe Treebeard's right. We don't belong here, Merry. It's too big for us. What can we do in the end? We've got the Shire. Maybe we should go home.

Merry Brandybuck:
The fires of Isengard will spread. And the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn. And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone. There won't be a Shire, Pippin.

[Having gone south at Pippin's request, Treebeard sees the devastation of Fangorn]

Treebeard:
[horrified] Many of these trees were my friends. Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.

Pippin:
I'm sorry, Treebeard.

Treebeard:
They had voices of their own... [angrily as he looks at Isengard] Saruman... A wizard should know better! [he lets out a howl of rage that echoes across the forest] There is no curse in Elvish, Entish or the tongues of Men for this treachery!

Pippin:
Look, the trees! They're moving!

Merry:
Where are they going?

Treebeard:
They have business with the Orcs. My business is with Isengard tonight, with rock and stone! [More Ents emerge from the forest]

Merry:
Yes...!

Treebeard:
Come, my friends. The Ents are going to war. It is likely that we go to our doom...the Last March of the Ents!

ThÃ©oden:
The fortress is taken. It is over.

Aragorn:
You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it! They still defend it! They have died defending it! [to Gamling] Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves? Is there no other way?!

Gamling:
There is one passage, it leads into the mountains. But they will not get far, the Uruk-Hai are too many!

Aragorn:
Send word for the women and children to make for the mountain pass and barricade the entrance!

ThÃ©oden:
So much death... what can Men do against such reckless hate?

Aragorn:
Ride out with me. Ride out and meet them.

ThÃ©oden:
For death and glory?

Aragorn:
For Rohan. For your people.

Gimli:
The sun is rising... [Sunlight enters through a window, illuminating the room]

Gandalf the White:
[narration] Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day. At dawn, look to the East.

ThÃ©oden:
Yes...yes! The Horn of Helm Hammerhand shall sound in the Deep...one last time!

Gimli:
Yes!

ThÃ©oden:
[to Aragorn] Let this be the hour when we draw swords together! [to his men] Fell deeds awake. Now for wrath, now for ruin and the red dawn! [the Uruks break down the doors] FORTH EORLINGAS! CHARGE!

[Frodo attacks Sam with his sword]

Samwise Gamgee:
It's me. It's your Sam. Don't you know your Sam?

[Frodo snaps out of the spell, horrified, and drops his sword]

Frodo Baggins:
I can't do this, Sam.

Samwise Gamgee:
I know. It's all wrong. By rights we shouldn't even be here. But we are. [watching the NazgÃ»l flying away] It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo; the ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger, they were. And sometimes you didn't want to know the end... because how could the end be happy? How could the world go back to the way it was, when so much bad had happened? But in the end, it's only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer. Those were the stories that stayed with you, that meant something, even if you were too small to understand why. But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now. Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't. They kept going. Because they were holding on to something.

Frodo Baggins:
What are we holding on to, Sam?

Samwise Gamgee:
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo. And it's worth fighting for.

Samwise Gamgee:
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.

Frodo Baggins:
What?

Samwise Gamgee:
I wonder if people will ever say, Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring, and they'll say, Yes, that's one of my favorite stories. Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad? Yes, my boy. The most famousest of Hobbits. And that's saying a lot.

Frodo Baggins:
You left out one of the chief characters: Samwise the Brave. I want to hear more about Sam. [Frodo stops walking and turns around to face Sam] Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.

Samwise Gamgee:
Now Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun. I was being serious.

Frodo Baggins:
[smiling] So was I. [walks ahead]

Samwise Gamgee:
[to himself] Samwise the Brave.

[last lines]

SmÃ©agol:
Master... Master looks after us. Master wouldn't hurt us.

Gollum:
Master broke his promise!

SmÃ©agol:
Don't ask SmÃ©agol. Poor, poor SmÃ©agol...

Gollum:
Master betrayed us! Wicked, tricksy, false. We ought to wring his filthy little neck. Kill him! Kill him! Kill them both! And then we takes the precious... and we be the master!

SmÃ©agol:
The fat hobbit, he knows. Eyes always watching.

Gollum:
Then we stabs them out! Put out his eyeses! Make him crawl!

SmÃ©agol:
Yes! Yes! Yes!

Gollum:
Kill them both.

SmÃ©agol:
Yes! No, no! It's too risky, it's too risky.

Gollum:
[sly] We could let her do it.

SmÃ©agol:
Yes... she could do it!

Gollum:
Yes, precious, she could. And then we takes it once they're dead.

SmÃ©agol:
Once they're dead...

Gollum:
Shhhh...

SmÃ©agol:
[to Frodo and Sam] Come on, hobbits. Long ways to go yet. SmÃ©agol will show you the way.

Gollum:
Follow me.

The Battle for Middle-earth Begins.

The Journey Continues.

The Fellowship Is Broken.

A New Power is Rising.

Save the Precious.

Pippin Took:
Merry? Merry! Wake up. [to the Uruks] My friend is sick. He needs water. Please!

Uglúk:
Sick is he? Give him some medicine, boys!

[The Uruks pour Orc-liquor down Merry's throat, which he coughs and spits out]

Pippin Took:
Stop it!

Uglúk:
Can't take his draught! [laughs cruelly]

Pippin Took:
Leave him alone!

Uglúk:
Why? You want some? Huh? Then keep your mouth shutt.

Pippin Took:
Merry.

Merry Brandybuck:
Hello, Pip.

Pippin Took:
You're hurt.

Merry Brandybuck:
I'm fine. It was just an act.

Pippin Took:
An act?

Merry Brandybuck:
[smiles] See? Fooled you too. Don't worry about me, Pippin.

[Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are tracking Merry and Pippin through Fangorn Forest]

Aragorn:
These are strange tracks.

Gimli:
The air is so close in here!

Legolas:
This forest is old. Very old... full of memory... and anger.

[the trees groan, Gimli holds up his axe]

Legolas:
The trees are speaking to each other.

Aragorn:
[whispers loudly] Gimli! Lower your axe.

Legolas:
They have feelings, my friend. [Gimli lowers his axe] The Elves began it. Waking up the trees, teaching them to speak.

Gimli:
Talking trees? What do trees have to talk about, hm? Except the consistency of squirrel droppings.

Legolas:
[in Elvish] Aragorn, something's out there.

Aragorn:
[in Elvish] What do you see?

Legolas:
[in common tongue] The White Wizard approaches.

Aragorn:
Do not let him speak. He will put a spell on us. [Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli ready their weapons] We must be quick.

[They turn to confront the White Wizard, who appears before them enveloped in a blinding light. Gimli hurls his axe, and Legolas shoots an arrow, which the White Wizard deflects with his staff. Aragorn holds up his sword, which burns hot in his hand, forcing him to drop it]

White Wizard:
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.

Aragorn:
Where are they?

White Wizard:
They passed this way, the day before yesterday. They met someone they did not expect. Does that comfort you?

Aragorn:
Who are you? Show yourself! [the White Wizard reveals himself to be Gandalf] It cannot be!

Legolas:
Forgive me. I mistook you for Saruman.

Gandalf:
I am Saruman. Or rather, Saruman as he should have been.

Aragorn:
You fell.

Gandalf:
Through fire and water. From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak, I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth. Until at last, I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside. Darkness took me. And I strayed out of thought and time. Stars wheeled overhead and everyday was as long as a life-age of the earth. But it was not the end. I felt life in me again. I've been sent back until my task is done.

Aragorn:
Gandalf...

Gandalf:
Gandalf? Yes... that's what they used to call me. Gandalf the Grey. That was my name.

Gimli:
[surprised] Gandalf!

Gandalf:
I am Gandalf the White. And I come back to you now, at the turn of the tide. One stage of your journey is over, another begins. War has come to Rohan. We must ride to Edoras with all speed.

[Extended Edition only, Gimli is getting desperately worried about the fates of Merry and Pippin]

Gimli:
Are we going to leave those poor little Hobbits here in this horrid, dark, dank, tree-infested–! [reacts to the sound of the trees] I mean...charming, quite charming, forest?

Gandalf:
It was more than mere chance that brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn. A great power has been sleeping here for many long years. The coming of Merry and Pippin will be like the falling of small stones that starts an avalanche in the mountains.

Aragorn:
And one thing you have not changed, my friend.

Gandalf:
Hmm?

Aragorn:
You still speak in riddles.

Gandalf:
A thing is about to happen that has not happened since the elder days. The Ents are going to wake up...and find that they are strong.

Gimli:
Strong?! Oh, that's good.

Gandalf:
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf! Merry and Pippin are quite safe! In fact, they are far safer than you are about to be!

Gimli:
[to himself] This new Gandalf's more grumpy than the old one.

Frodo Baggins:
[about to enter the Black Gate] I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.

Samwise Gamgee:
I know, Mr. Frodo. I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.

Frodo Baggins:
Now!

[Frodo and Sam lunge forward to make a run for the Black Gate, but Sméagol grabs them and pulls them back]

Sméagol:
NO! No, Master! They catch you! They catch you! Don't take it to him! He wants the precious! Always, he is looking for it! And the precious is wanting to go back to him. But we mustn't let him have it.

[An Orc horn sounds in the distance, and the Black Gate begins to close. Frodo tries again to run toward it, but Sméagol grabs his arm, holding him back.]

Sméagol:
No! There's another way. More secret, a dark way.

Samwise Gamgee:
Why haven't you spoken of this before?!

Sméagol:
Because Master did not ask.

Samwise Gamgee:
[to Frodo] He's up to something!

Frodo Baggins:
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?

Sméagol:
Yes. There's a path, and some stairs, and then... a tunnel.

Frodo Baggins:
[after a brief pause] He's led us this far, Sam.

Samwise Gamgee:
Mr. Frodo, no.

Frodo Baggins:
He's been true to his word.

Samwise Gamgee:
No.

Frodo Baggins:
Lead the way, Sméagol.

Sméagol:
Good Sméagol always helps.

[Extended Edition only, Pippin is drinking water from a spring in Fangorn Forest]

Pippin Took:
I had the loveliest dream last night. There was this large barrel full of pipe-weed. And we smoked all of it. And then... you were sick. I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.

Merry Brandybuck:
[hearing a tree moan] Did you hear that? [hearing it again] There it is again! Something's not right here, not right at all. [Pippin stands up and groans, sounding much like a moaning tree] You just said something...treeish!

Pippin Took:
No, I didn't, I was just stretching. [he 'groans' again, growing slightly]

Merry Brandybuck:
You're taller!

Pippin Took:
Who?

Merry Brandybuck:
You!

Pippin Took:
Than what?

Merry Brandybuck:
Than me!

Pippin Took:
I've always been taller than you!

Merry Brandybuck:
Pippin, everyone knows, I'm the tall one, you're the short one.

Pippin Took:
Please, Merry. You're, what, three foot six? At the most? Whereas me, I'm pushing three-seven. [groans and grows more noticeably] Three-eight! [drinks more water]

Merry Brandybuck:
Three foot eight? [realizing] You did something.

[Pippin smiles innocently and places the bowl of forest water down. Merry, realizing the water is making Pippin taller, steals a pot and drinks some himself]

Treebeard:
The trees have grown wild and dangerous. Anger festers in their hearts. Black are their thoughts. Strong is their hate. They will harm you if they can. There are too few of us now. Too few of us Ents left to manage them.

Pippin Took:
Why are there so few of you, when you've lived so long? Are there Ent children?

Treebeard:
Bru-ra-hoom. There have been no Entings for a terrible long count of years.

Merry Brandybuck:
Why is that?

Treebeard:
We lost the Entwives.

Pippin Took:
Oh, I'm sorry. How did they die?

Treebeard:
Die? No. We lost them, and now we cannot find them. I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire?

Merry Brandybuck:
Can't say that I have. You, Pip?

Pippin Took:
What do they look like?

Treebeard:
I don't remember now.

[Gríma's treachery is revealed and he is thrown out of the hall]

Gríma Wormtongue:
[pleading as he crawls away] I've only ever served you, my lord!

Théoden:
[furious, advancing on Gríma with his sword in hand] Your leech-craft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!

Gríma Wormtongue:
[pleading] Send me not from your sight! [Théoden raises his sword to kill when Aragorn intervenes]

Aragorn:
No, my lord! No, my lord. Let him go. Enough blood has been spilled on his account. [Aragorn offers his hand to Gríma, who spits on it in insult]

Gríma Wormtongue:
[pushing his way through the crowd] Get out of my way!

Háma:
Hail, Théoden King!

[The people of Rohan bow before Théoden, who looks around him anxiously]

Théoden:
Where is Théodred? Where is my son?

Gollum:
We wants it, we needs it. Must have the precious. They stole it from us. Sneaky little hobbitses! Wicked, tricksy, false!

they're taking the hobbits to isengard!

Orc Captain:
We’ve been wearing this prosthetic face for 3 stinkin days!

Gandalf The White:
The Grey Pilgrim, that’s what they used to call me.

Saruman The White:
It will begin in Rohan. Too long have these peasants stood against you...but no more. Rohan, my lord, is ready to fall.

Gimli :
Certainty of death. Small chance of success. What are we waiting for?


Frodo Baggins:
The Ring is mine!

Frodo Baggins:
And thus it was a Fourth Age of Middle-earth began. And the Fellowship of the Ring, though eternally bound by friendship and love, was ended.

Frodo Baggins:
How do you pick up the threads of an old life? How do you go on, when in your heart you begin to understand... there is no going back? There are some things that time cannot mend. Some hurts that go too deep, that have taken hold.

Aragorn:
I do not fear death.

Aragorn:
Sons of Gondor! Of Rohan! My brothers! I see in your eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me! A day may come when the courage of men fails, when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship. But it is not this day. An hour of wolves and shattered shields when the age of Men comes crashing down! But it is not this day! This day we fight! By all that you hold dear on this good Earth, I bid you stand! Men of the West!

Aragorn:
For Frodo.

Aragorn:
[To the four Hobbits of the Fellowship, following Mordor's defeat] My friends... you bow to no one.

Gandalf the White:
[To Pippin, in the extended edition] They guard it because they have hope. Faith and fading hope that one day it will flower. That a king will come and this city will be as it once was before it fell into decay. The old wisdom that was borne out of the West was forsaken. Kings made tombs more splendid than the houses of the living and counted the names of their descent dearer than the names of their sons. Childless lords sat in aged halls musing on heraldry or in high, cold towers asking questions of the stars. And so the people of Gondor fell into ruin. The line of Kings failed, the White Tree withered, and the rule of Gondor was given over to lesser men.

Gandalf the White:
[to Pippin]: Now, listen carefully. Lord Denethor is Boromir's father. To give him news of his beloved son's death would be most unwise. And do not mention Frodo, or the Ring. And say nothing of Aragorn either. [hesitates] In fact, it's better if you don't speak at all, Peregrin Took.

Gandalf the White:
Of all the inquisitive hobbits, Peregrin Took, you are the worst!

Gandalf the White:
We come to it at last.

Gandalf the White:
The board is set. The pieces are moving.

Gandalf the White:
This is no place for a Hobbit!

Gandalf the White:
[to soldiers panicking from the attacking Ringwraiths] Hold them back! Do not give into fear! Stand to your posts! FIGHT!

Gimli:
There's plenty for the both of us. May the best dwarf win.

Gimli:
[after Legolas takes down an oliphaunt and its crew] That still only counts as one!

Gimli:
Certainty of death. Small chance of success. What are we waiting for?

Gollum:
They cursed us. 'Murderer', they called us. They cursed us, and drove us away. And we wept, precious. We wept to be so alone. And we forgot the taste of bread, the sound of trees, the softness of the wind. We even forgot our own name. My precious.

Denethor:
You may triumph on the field of battle for a day, but against the power that is risen in the East, there is no victory!

Arwen:
From the ashes, a fire shall be woken. A light from the shadow shall spring. Renewed shall be blade that was broken. The crownless again shall be king.

Ã‰omer:
[to Ã‰owyn, about Merry] You know as little of war as that Hobbit. When the fear takes him, and the blood, and the screams, and the horrors of battle take hold, do you think he would stand and fight? He would flee. And it would be right to do so. War is the province of Men, Ã‰owyn.

Theoden:
Reform the line. Reform the line! Sound the charge; take them head on. Charge!!

Sam Gamgee:
[kills an Orc] That's for Frodo! [kills another Orc] That's for the Shire! [kills the third Orc] And that's for my old Gaffer!

SmÃ©agol:
Give us that, DÃ©agol, my love.

DÃ©agol:
Why?

SmÃ©agol:
Because it's my birthday...and I wants it.

[DÃ©agol refuses, and the two get into a fight that ends with SmÃ©agol strangling him to death. SmÃ©agol then takes the Ring]

SmÃ©agol:
My... Precious...

[The following only appears in the Extended Edition]

Saruman:
You have fought many wars and slain many Men, ThÃ©oden king, and made peace afterwards. Can we not take council together as we once did, my old friend? Can we not have peace, you and I?

ThÃ©oden:
We shall have peace. We shall have peace, when you answer for the burning of the Westfold, and the children that lie dead there! We shall have peace, when the lives of the soldiers, whose bodies were hewn even as they lay dead against the Gates of the Hornburg, are avenged! When you hang from a gibbet, for the sport of your own crows, we shall have peace!

Saruman:
Gibbets and crows?! Dotard! [to Gandalf] What do you want, Gandalf Greyhame? Let me guess. The Key of Orthanc? Or perhaps the keys of Barad-dÃ»r itself, along with the crowns of the Seven Kings, and the rods of the Five Wizards!

Gandalf the White:
Your treachery has already cost many lives. Thousands more are now at risk. But you could save them, Saruman. You were deep in the enemy's council.

Saruman:
So you have come here for information? I have some for you. [holds out the PalantÃ­r] Something festers in the heart of Middle Earth. Something that you have failed to see. But the Great Eye has seen it. Even now, he presses his advantage. His attack will come soon. You are all going to die. But you know this, don't you, Gandalf? [indicates Aragorn] You cannot think that this Ranger will ever sit upon the Throne of Gondor! This exile, crept from the shadows, will never be crowned king! Gandalf does not hesitate to sacrifice those closest to him, those he professes to love. Tell me, what words of comfort did you give the halfling, before you sent him to his doom? The path that you have set him on can only lead to death.

Gimli:
I've heard enough! [to Legolas] Shoot him, stick an arrow in his gob!

Gandalf the White:
No. Come down, Saruman, and your life will be spared.

Saruman:
Save your pity and your mercy! I have no use for it! [shoots a ball of fire from his staff at Gandalf, who emerges unharmed]

Gandalf the White:
[sternly] Saruman! Your staff is broken! [as he speaks, Saruman's staff shatters in his hands. From behind him, GrÃ­ma Wormtongue appears]

ThÃ©oden:
GrÃ­ma! You need not follow him. You were not always as you are now. You were once a Man of Rohan! Come down.

Saruman:
A Man of Rohan? What is the House of Rohan, but a thatched barn, where brigards drink in the reek, and their brats roll on the floor with the dogs?! The victory at Helm's Deep does not belong to you, ThÃ©oden Horse Master! You are a lesser son of greater sires!

ThÃ©oden:
[to GrÃ­ma] GrÃ­ma, come down. Be free of him.

Saruman:
Free?! He will never be free!

GrÃ­ma Wormtongue:
No.

Saruman:
Get down, cur! [hits him across the face]

Gandalf the White:
Saruman! You were deep in the enemy's council. Tell us what you know.

Saruman:
You withdraw your guard and I will tell you where your doom will be decided. I will not be held prisoner here!

[From behind him, GrÃ­ma suddenly stabs him the back numerous times. Legolas shoots him with an arrow to the heart, killing him, while Saruman topples from Orthanc to his death on a spiked wheel below]

Samwise Gamgee:
[hands Frodo some lembas bread] Here.

Frodo Baggins:
What about you?

Samwise Gamgee:
I'm not hungry. Leastways, not for lembas bread.

Frodo Baggins:
Sam.

Samwise Gamgee:
Alright. We don't have that much left. We have to be careful or we're going to run out. You go ahead and eat that, Mr Frodo. I've rationed it. There should be enough.

Frodo Baggins:
For what?

Samwise Gamgee:
The journey home.

Aragorn:
No news of Frodo?

Gandalf the White:
No word. Nothing.

Aragorn:
We still have time. Every day Frodo moves closer to Mordor.

Gandalf the White:
Do we know that?

Aragorn:
What does your heart tell you?

Gandalf the White:
That Frodo is alive. Yes. Yes, he is alive.

SmÃ©agol:
[talking in his sleep] Too risky, too risky. The thieves! They stole it from us. Kill them. Kill them. kill them both! [wakes up] No!

Gollum:
Shhh! Quiet! Mustn't wake them, mustn't ruin it now!

SmÃ©agol:
But they knows, they knows. They suspects us!

Gollum:
What is it saying, my Precious, my love? Is SmÃ©agol losing his nerve?

SmÃ©agol:
No! Not! Never! SmÃ©agol hates nasty Hobbitses! Smeagol wants to see them... dead.

Gollum:
And we will. SmÃ©agol did it once, he can do it again. It's ours. Ours!

SmÃ©agol:
We must get the Precious. We must get it back!

Gollum:
Patience! Patience, my love. First we must lead them to her.

SmÃ©agol:
We lead them to the winding stair.

Gollum:
Yes, the stairs. And then?

SmÃ©agol:
Up, up, up, up, up the stairs we go. Until we come to... the tunnel!

Gollum:
And when they go in, there's no coming out. She's always hungry, she always needs to feed. She must eat, or she gets filthy Orcses.

SmÃ©agol:
And they doesn't taste very nice, does they, Precious?

Gollum:
No... not very nice at all, my love. She hungers for sweeter meats. Hobbit meat. And when she throws away the bones, and the empty clothes, then we will find it!

SmÃ©agol:
And take it for me!

Gollum:
[menacing] For us.

SmÃ©agol:
[cowed] Yes, we... we meant for us.

Gollum:
[coughs] Gollum! Gollum! The Precious will be ours once the Hobbitses are dead! [Gollum sees Sam's reflection over his shoulder, having heard everything]

Samwise Gamgee:
You treacherous little toad! [hits SmÃ©agol]

Gandalf the White:
There was no lie in Pippin's eyes. A fool, but an honest fool he remains. He told Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring. We've been strangely fortunate. Pippin saw in the PalantÃ­r a glimpse of the Enemy's plan. Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas Tirith. His defeat at Helm's Deep showed our Enemy one thing. He knows the Heir of Elendil has come forth. Men are not as weak as he supposed. There is courage still, strength enough perhaps to challenge him. Sauron fears this. He will not risk the Peoples of Middle Earth uniting under one banner. He will raze Minas Tirith to the ground before he sees a King return to the Throne of Men. If the Beacons of Gondor are lit, Rohan must be ready for war.

ThÃ©oden:
Tell me, why should we ride to the aid of those who did not come to ours? What do we owe Gondor?

Aragorn:
I will go.

Gandalf the White:
No.

Aragorn:
They must be warned.

Gandalf the White:
They will be. You must come by another road. Follow the River. Look to the Black Ships. Understand this. Things are now in motion that cannot be undone. I ride for Minas Tirith. [Glances at Pippin] And I won't be going alone.

Merry Brandybuck:
Here. [hands Pippin tobacco] Something for the road.

Pippin Took:
The last of the Longbottom Leaf.

Merry Brandybuck:
I know you've run out. You smoke too much, Pip.

Pippin Took:
But we'll see each other soon? Won't we?

Merry Brandybuck:
I don't know. I don't know what's going to happen.

Arwen:
You have the gift of foresight. Tell me what you have see?

Elrond:
I looked into your future and I saw death.

Arwen:
But there is also life. You saw there was a child. You saw my son.

Elrond:
That future is almost gone.

Arwen:
But it is not lost.

Elrond:
Nothing is certain.

Arwen:
Some things are certain: if I leave him now, I will regret it forever.

Gandalf the White:
Hail, Denethor, Son of Ecthelion, Lord and Steward of Gondor. I come with tidings in this dark hour, and with counsel.

Denethor:
Perhaps you come to explain this? [holds up Boromir's broken horn] Perhaps you come to tell me why my son is dead?

Pippin Took:
Boromir died to save us, my kinsman and me. He fell, defending us from many foes.

Gandalf the White:
Pippin!

Pippin Took:
[kneels before Denethor] I offer you my service, such as it is, in payment of this debt.

Denethor:
This is my first command to you. How did you escape and my son did not, so mighty a Man as he was?

Pippin Took:
The mightiest Man may be slain by one arrow. Boromir was pierced by many.

Gandalf the White:
Get up! [to Denethor] My Lord, there will be a time to grieve for Boromir, but it is not now. War is coming. The Enemy is on your doorstep! As Steward, you are charged with the defense of this city. Where are Gondor's armies? You still have friends. You are not alone in this fight. Send word to ThÃ©oden of Rohan. Light the beacons.

Denethor:
You think you are wise, Mithrandir, yet for all your subtleties you have not wisdom. Do you think the eyes of the White Tower are blind? I have seen more than you know. With your left hand you would use me as a shield against Mordor and with your right you would seek to supplant me. I know who rides with ThÃ©oden of Rohan. Oh, yes. Word has reached my ears of this Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and I tell you now, I will not bow to this Ranger from the North! Last of a ragged house, long bereft of Lordship.

Gandalf the White:
Authority is not given to you to deny the return of the King, Steward!

Denethor:
The rule of Gondor is mine! And no other's!

Gandalf the White:
All has turned to vain ambition! He would even use his grief as a cloak! A thousand years this city has stood. Now, at the whim of a madman, it will fall. And the White Tree, the Tree of the King, will never bloom again.

Pippin Took:
Why are they still guarding it then?

Gandalf the White:
They guard it because they have hope. A faint and fading hope, that one day it will flower. A King will come, and this city will be as it once was. Before it fell into decay. The old wisdom born out of the West was forsaken. Kings made tombs more splendid than the houses of the living, and counted the names of their descent dearer than the names of their sons. Childless lords sat in aged halls, musing on heraldry, or in high cold towers asking questions of the stars. And so, the people of Gondor fell into ruin. The line of Kings failed. The White Tree withered. The rule of Gondor was given over to lesser men.

Pippin Took:
[staring towards Mordor] Mordor.

Gandalf the White:
Yes, there it lies. This city has dwelt ever in the sight of its shadow.

Pippin Took:
A storm is coming.

Gandalf the White:
This is not the weather of the world. This is a devise of Sauron's making, a broil of fume he sends ahead of his host. The Orcs of Mordor have no love of daylight. So he covers the face of the sun to ease their passage along the road to war. When the shadow of Mordor reaches this city, it will begin.

Pippin Took:
Well, Minas Tirith, very impressive. So where are we off to next?

Gandalf the White:
Oh, it's too late for that, Peregrin. There's no leaving this city. Help must come to us.

Pippin Took:
[looking at his armor] So, I imagine this is just a ceremonial position. I mean, they don't actually expect me to do any fighting. Do they?

Gandalf the White:
You're in the service of the Steward now. You're going to have to do as you're told, Peregrin Took, Guard of the Citadel!

Pippin Took:
It's so quiet.

Gandalf the White:
It's the deep breath before the plunge.

Pippin Took:
I don't want to be in a battle, but waiting on the edge of one I can't escape is even worse. Is there any hope, Gandalf... for Frodo and Sam?

Gandalf the White:
There never was much hope. Just a fool's hope. Our enemy is almost ready, his full strength gathered. Not only Orcs, but men as well; legions of Haradrim from the South, mercenaries from the coast- All will answer Mordor' s call. This will be the end of Gondor as we know it. Here the hammerstroke will fall hardest. If the river is taken, if the garrison at Osgiliath falls, the last defence of this city will be gone.

Pippin Took:
But we have the White Wizard. That's got to count for something. [Gandalf does not answer] Gandalf?

Gandalf the White:
Sauron has yet to reveal his deadliest servant. The one who will lead Mordor's armies in war. The one they say no living Man can kill. The Witch-King of Angmar! You've met him before. He stabbed Frodo on Weathertop. He is the Lord of the NazgÃ»l, the greatest of the Nine. Minas Morgul is his lair.

Faramir:
Mithrandir! They broke through our defenses! They've taken the bridge and the west bank. Battalions of Orcs are crossing the river.

Irolas:
It is as the Lord Denethor predicted. Long has he foreseen this doom.

Gandalf:
Foreseen and done nothing!

[Faramir stares at Pippin]

Gandalf:
Faramir? This is not the first halfling to have crossed your path.

Faramir:
No.

Pippin:
You've seen Frodo and Sam?

Gandalf:
Where? When?

Faramir:
In Ithilien. Not two days ago. Gandalf, they're taking the road to the Morgul Vale.

Gandalf:
And then the pass of Cirith Ungol.

Pippin:
What does that mean? What's wrong?

Gandalf:
Faramir, tell me everything.

SmÃ©agol:
Master? Master carries heavy burden. SmÃ©agol knows. Heavy, heavy burden. Fat one cannot know. SmÃ©agol look after Master.

[Gollum puts his hand on Frodo's head]

Gollum:
He wants it.

SmÃ©agol:
He needs it. SmÃ©agol sees it in his eye. Very soon, he will ask you for it. You will see.

Gollum:
The fat one will take it from you.

[Frodo looks at Sam suspiciously]

Witch King:
Send forth all legions. Do not stop the attack until the city is taken. Slay them all!

Gothmog:
What of the wizard?

Witch King:
I will break him.

Denethor:
Is there a captain here who still has the courage to do his lord's will?

Faramir:
You wish now that our places had been exchanged - that I had died and Boromir had lived.

Denethor:
Yes. I wish that.

Faramir:
Since you were robbed of Boromir, I will do what I can in his stead. If I should return, think better of me, Father.

Denethor:
That will depend on the manner of your return.

[While Frodo and Sam are sleeping, Gollum wakes up, takes the Elven bread, sprinkles some onto a sleeping Sam, and throws the bread off the cliff they are on. Sam wakes up]

Sam:
What are you up to? Sneaking off, are we?

SmÃ©agol:
Sneaking? [indignant] S-sneaking?! Fat hobbit is always so polite. SmÃ©agol shows them secret ways that nobody else could find, and they say sneak! Sneak?! Very nice friend. Oh, yes, my precious. Very nice, very nice...

Sam:
All right! All right. You just startled me is all. What were you doing?

SmÃ©agol:
[sarcastic] Sneaking.

Sam:
Fine. Have it your own way. [Wakes Frodo] I'm sorry to wake you, Mr. Frodo. We have to be moving on.

Frodo:
It's dark still.

Sam:
It's always dark here. [Notices the bread is missing] It's gone. The Elvin bread.

Frodo:
What? That's all we have left.

[Sam looks at Gollum]

Sam:
He took it. He must have.

SmÃ©agol:
SmÃ©agol?! No, no, not poor SmÃ©agol. SmÃ©agol hates nasty Elf bread.

Sam:
You're a lying wretch! What did you do with it?!

Frodo:
He doesn't eat it. He can't have taken it.

[Gollum notices the crumbs on Sam's jacket]

Gollum:
Look. What's this? [Takes the crumbs off the jacket and gasps] Crumbs on his jacketses! He took it! He took it! I've seen him. He's always stuffing his face when Master's not looking.

Sam:
That's a filthy lie! [Attacks Gollum] You sneaking, two-faced sneak!

Frodo:
Sam! Stop it! Sam! [Pulls Sam away from Gollum] Sam! No!

Sam:
Oh, my! I'm sorry. I didn't mean it to go so far. I was just so, so angry. Here, let's, let's just rest a bit.

Frodo:
I'm all right.

Sam:
No. You're not all right. You're exhausted. It's that Gollum. It's this place. It's that thing around your neck. I could help a bit. I could carry it for a while. [The words echo in Frodo's mind] Carry it for a while...I could carry it...I could carry it...Share the load...Share the load...The load...The load...

[Frodo pushes Sam away upon hearing the echoes]

Frodo:
Get away!!

Sam:
I don't want to keep it! I just want to help.

[A smiling Gollum appears behind Frodo]

Gollum:
See? See? He wants it for himself.

[Frodo looks at Sam in shock]

Sam:
Shut up, you! Go away! Get out of here!

Frodo:
No, Sam. It's you. I'm sorry, Sam.

[Gollum smirks; his plan is working]

Sam:
But he's a liar. He's poisoned you against me!

Frodo:
You can't help me anymore.

Sam:
You don't mean that.

Frodo:
Go home.

[Sam breaks down in tears, as Frodo and Gollum leave to continue their climb to Mordor]

Ã‰omer:
[about Merry] You should not not encourage him.

Ã‰owyn:
You should not doubt him.

Ã‰omer:
I do not doubt his heart. Only the reach of his arm.

Ã‰owyn:
Why should Merry be left behind? Why can he not fight for those he loves?

Ã‰omer:
You know as little of war as that Hobbit. When the fear takes him, and the blood, and the screams, and the horrors of battle take hold, do you think he would stand and fight? He would flee. And it would be right to do so. War is the province of Men, Ã‰owyn.

Theoden:
I take my leave.

Aragorn:
My Lord Elrond.

Elrond:
I come on behalf of one whom I love. Arwen is dying. She will not long survive the evil that now spreads from Mordor. The light of the Evenstar is failing. As Sauron's power grows, her strength wanes. Arwen's life is now tied to the fate of the Ring. The Shadow is upon us, Aragorn. The end has come.

Aragorn:
It will not be our end but his.

Elrond:
You ride to war, but not to victory. Sauron's armies march on Minas Tirith, this you know. But, in secret he sends another force which will attack from the river. A fleet of Corsair ships sails from the south. They'll be in the city in two days. You're outnumbered, Aragorn. You need more men.

Aragorn:
There are none.

Elrond:
There are those who dwell in the mountain.

Aragorn:
Murderers. Traitors. You would call upon them to fight? They believe in nothing. They answer to no one.

Elrond:
They will answer to the king of Gondor. [pulls out Anduril]

Elrond:
Anduril, Flame of the West, forged from the shards of Narsil.

Aragorn:
Sauron will not have forgotten the sword of Elendil. The blade that was broken shall return to Minas Tirith.

Elrond:
The man who can wield the power of this sword can summon to him an army more deadly than any that walks this earth. Put aside the Ranger. Become who you were born to be. Take the Dimholt Road. Ã“nen i-estel edain. (I give hope to mankind)

Aragorn:
Ãš-chebin estel anim. (I keep none for myself)

[Aragorn readies to take the Paths of the Dead. He leads his horse towards the entrance and passes by Gimli, who stops him]

Gimli:
Where do you think you're going?

Aragorn:
Not this time, Gimli. This time you must stay.

[Legolas walks up to them, leading his horse]

Legolas:
Have you learned nothing of the stubbornness of Dwarves?

Gimli:
You may as well accept it. We're going with you, laddy.

Legolas:
[reading the inscription over the cave] The way is shut. It was made by those who are dead, and the dead keep it. The way is shut.

Aragorn:
I do not fear death.

[Aragorn enters, followed by Legolas]

Gimli:
Well this is a thing unheard of! An Elf will go underground, when a Dwarf dare not! [enters] Oh, I'd never hear the end of it!

King of the Dead:
The Dead do not suffer the living to pass.

Aragorn:
You will suffer me. (the King of the Dead laughes and summons his army)

King of the Dead:
The way is shut. It was made by those who are dead, and the dead keep it. The way is shut, and now you must die!

Aragorn:
I summon you to fulfill your oath!

King of the Dead:
None but the king of Gondor may command me. [swings sword; Aragorn blocks him with the sword Anduril] That blade was broken!

Aragorn:
[takes him by the throat] It has been remade. [he releases the King of the Dead] Fight for us, and reclaim your honour! What say you? What say you?!

Gimli:
You waste your time, Aragorn! They had no honour in life; they have none now in death!

Aragorn:
I am Isildur's Heir! Fight for me, and I will hold your oaths fulfilled! WHAT SAY YOU?!

Gandalf:
Go back to the Abyss! Fall into the nothingness that awaits you and your master!

Witch-King:
Do you not know death when you see it, old man?! [Pippin screams] This is MY hour!

Witch-King:
You have failed. The world of Men will fall.

Theoden:
Eomer. Take your Ãˆored down the left flank. Gamling, follow the King's banner down the center. Grimbold, take your company right, after you pass the wall. Forth, and fear no darkness! Arise! Arise, Riders of Theoden! Spears shall be shaken, shields shall be splintered! A sword day... a red day... ere the sun rises! [The Rohirrim and Orcs ready their weapons for battle]

Eowyn:
[to Merry] Whatever happens, stay with me. I'll look after you.

[the King rides past his men, hitting their spears with his sword as he goes]

Theoden:
Ride now!... Ride now!... Ride! Ride to ruin and the world's ending! Death!

All:
DEATH! [the chant is repeated twice more]

Theoden:
Forth, Eorlingas!

Pippin Took:
I didn't think it would end this way.

Gandalf the White:
End? No, the journey doesn't end here. Death is just another path. One that we all must take. The grey rain-curtain of this world rolls back, and all turns to silver glass... then you see it!

Pippin Took:
What? Gandalf? See what?

Gandalf the White:
White shores... and beyond. A far green country, under a swift sunrise.

Pippin Took:
Well, that isn't so bad.

Gandalf the White:
[smiles] No... no, it isn't.

Witch-King:
You fool! No Man can kill me. Die now!

[Merry suddenly appears and stabs the Witch-King on the leg, dropping the Witch-King to his knees. Ã‰owyn takes off her helmet, revealing herself]

Ã‰owyn:
I am no Man.

[She stabs the Witch-King straight into his face, killing him]

ThÃ©oden:
[dying] I know your face. Ã‰owyn, my eyes darken.

Ã‰owyn:
No, no. I'm going to save you.

ThÃ©oden:
You already did. Ã‰owyn, my body is broken. You have to let me go. I go to my fathers, in whose mighty company, I shall now not be ashamed. Ã‰owyn. [dies]

Gandalf the White:
Frodo has passed beyond my sight. The darkness is deepening.

Aragorn:
If Sauron had the Ring, we would know it.

Gandalf the White:
It's only a matter of time. He's suffered a defeat, yes, but... behind the walls of Mordor, our enemy is regrouping.

Gimli:
Let him stay there. Let him rot! Why should we care?

Gandalf the White:
Because ten thousand Orcs now stand between Frodo and Mount Doom. I've sent him to his death.

Aragorn:
No. There is still hope for Frodo. He needs time... and safe passage across the plains of Gorgoroth. We can give him that.

Gimli:
How?

Aragorn:
Draw out Sauron's armies. Empty his lands. Then we gather our full strength and march on the Black Gate.

Ã‰omer:
We cannot achieve victory through strength of arms.

Aragorn:
Not for ourselves. But we can give Frodo his chance if we keep Sauron's Eye fixed upon us. Keep him blind to all else that moves.

Legolas:
A diversion.

Gimli:
Certainty of death, small chance of success... What are we waiting for?

Gandalf the White:
Sauron will suspect a trap, he will not take the bait.

Aragorn:
Oh, I think he will.

Aragorn:
Let the Lord of the Black Land come forth!

[The following only appears in the Extended Edition]

Aragorn:
Let justice be done upon him!

[The Black Gate opens as the Mouth Of Sauron comes to meet them]

The Mouth of Sauron:
My master, Sauron the Great, bids thee welcome. [smiles] Is there any in this rout with authority to treat with me?

Gandalf the White:
We do not come to treat with Sauron, faithless and accursed. Tell your master this: the armies of Mordor must disband. He is to depart these lands, never to return.

The Mouth of Sauron:
Ahh, old Greybeard. I have a token I was bidden to show thee. [reveals Frodo's mithril vest and throws it at them]

Pippin:
[whispers] Frodo...

Gandalf:
Silence.

Merry:
No!

Gandalf:
Silence!

The Mouth of Sauron:
The halfling was dear to thee, I see. Know that he suffered greatly at the hands of his host. Who would've thought one so small could endure so much pain? And he did, Gandalf, he did. [Aragorn rides towards the Mouth of Sauron] And who is this? Isildur's heir? It takes more to make a King than a broken Elvish blade...

[Aragorn cuts off the Mouth of Sauron's head with one stroke of Anduril]

Gimli:
I guess that concludes negotiations.

Aragorn:
[to Gandalf] I do not believe it! I will not!

Gimli:
I never thought I'd die fighting side-by-side with an Elf.

Legolas:
What about side-by-side with a friend?

Gimli:
Aye... I could do that.

Samwise Gamgee:
Do you remember the Shire, Mr. Frodo? It'll be spring soon, and the orchards will be in blossom. And the birds will be nesting in the hazel thicket. And they'll be sowing the summer barley in the lower fields. And they'll be eating the first of the strawberries with cream. Do you remember the taste of strawberries?

Frodo Baggins:
No, Sam. I can't recall the taste of food, nor the sound of water, nor the touch of grass. Instead, I'm... naked in the dark. There's nothing. No veil between me and the wheel of fire! I can see him... with my waking eyes!

Samwise Gamgee:
Then let us be rid of it! Once and for all! Come on, Mr. Frodo. I can't carry it for you... but I can carry you! Come on! [carries Frodo]

[after destroying the One Ring]

Frodo Baggins:
It's gone! It's done!

Samwise Gamgee:
Yes, Mr. Frodo. It's over now.

Frodo Baggins:
[closes his eyes] I can see the Shire. The Brandywine River. Bag End. Gandalf's fireworks, the lights, the party tree.

Samwise Gamgee:
Rosie Cotton dancing. She had ribbons in her hair. If ever I was to marry someone... it would have been her. It would have been her!

Frodo Baggins:
I'm glad to be with you, Samwise Gamgee, here at the end of all things.

[at the Grey Havens]

Galadriel:
The power of the Three Rings is ended. The time has come...for the dominion of Men.

Elrond:
[in Elvish] The Sea calls us home.

Bilbo Baggins:
[smiling] I think I'm... quite ready for another adventure! [Bilbo climbs on board with Elrond. Galadriel follows with Celeborn]

Gandalf the White:
Farewell, my brave Hobbits. My work is now finished. Here at last, on the shores of the sea... comes the end of our Fellowship. I will not say do not weep, for not all tears are an evil. [heads to the ship, then turns around, waiting] It is time, Frodo.

Samwise Gamgee:
What does he mean?

Frodo Baggins:
We set out to save the Shire, Sam. And it has been saved... But not for me.

Samwise Gamgee:
[crying] You don't mean that. You can't leave.

Frodo Baggins:
[hands Sam the Red Book] The last pages are for you, Sam.

[last lines]

Frodo Baggins:
[voice over] My dear Sam. You cannot always be torn in two. You have to be one and whole for many years. You have so much to enjoy and to be and to do. Your part in the story will go on.

Samwise Gamgee:
[to his family] Well, I'm back.

A King Will Return.

The Beginning of the End of All Things.

The Fate of a Hobbit Lies in His Hands.

This Christmas. The Journey Ends.

There can be no triumph without loss. No victory without suffering. No freedom without sacrifice.

For Middle-Earth, and For the Fellowship!

Sam:
What we need is a few good taters.

Smeagol:
What's 'taters', precious?

Sam:
Po-ta-toes! Boil 'em, mash 'em, stick 'em in a stew. Lovely big golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish. Even you couldn't say no to that.

Smeagol:
Oh, yes we could! Spoiling nice fish! Give it to us raw-and wriggling! You keep nasty chips!

Sam:
You're hopeless.

Sméagol:
Give us that, Déagol, my love.

Déagol:
Why?

Sméagol:
Because it's my birthday...and I wants it.

[Déagol refuses, and the two get into a fight that ends with Sméagol strangling him to death. Sméagol then takes the Ring]

Sméagol:
My... Precious...

[Sméagol puts the Ring in his finger, causing him to be transported into the Shadow World; the scene changes to the Misty Mountains where Sméagol is mutating into Gollum]

Gollum:
[voice over] They cursed us. 'Murderer', they called us. They cursed us, and drove us away!

Sméagol:
[coughs] Gollum! Gollum! Gollum!

Gollum:
[voice over] And we wept, precious. We wept to be so alone. And we forgot the taste of bread, the sound of trees, the softness of the wind. We even forgot our own name. My precious.

Sméagol:
[talking in his sleep] Too risky, too risky. The thieves! They stole it from us. Kill them. Kill them. kill them both! [wakes up] No!

Gollum:
Shhh! Quiet! Mustn't wake them, mustn't ruin it now!

Sméagol:
But they knows, they knows. They suspects us!

Gollum:
What is it saying, my Precious, my love? Is Sméagol losing his nerve?

Sméagol:
No! Not! Never! Sméagol hates nasty Hobbitses! Smeagol wants to see them... dead.

Gollum:
And we will. Sméagol did it once, he can do it again. It's ours. Ours!

Sméagol:
We must get the Precious. We must get it back!

Gollum:
Patience! Patience, my love. First we must lead them to her.

Sméagol:
We lead them to the winding stair.

Gollum:
Yes, the stairs. And then?

Sméagol:
Up, up, up, up, up the stairs we go. Until we come to... the tunnel!

Gollum:
And when they go in, there's no coming out. She's always hungry, she always needs to feed. She must eat, or she gets filthy Orcses.

Sméagol:
And they doesn't taste very nice, does they, Precious?

Gollum:
No... not very nice at all, my love. She hungers for sweeter meats. Hobbit meat. And when she throws away the bones, and the empty clothes, then we will find it!

Sméagol:
And take it for me!

Gollum:
[menacing] For us.

Sméagol:
[cowed] Yes, we... we meant for us.

Gollum:
[coughs] Gollum! Gollum! The Precious will be ours... once the Hobbitses are dead! [Gollum sees Sam's reflection over his shoulder, having heard everything]

Samwise Gamgee:
You treacherous little prick! [hits Sméagol and begins strangling him]

Sméagol:
No! No! Master!

Frodo Baggins:
[wakes up] No, Sam! Leave him alone!

Samwise Gamgee:
I heard it from his own mouth! He means to murder us!

Sméagol:
Never! Sméagol wouldn't hurt a fly! [screams] He's a horrid, fat Hobbit, who hates poor Sméagol, and who makes up nasty lies!

Samwise Gamgee:
You miserable little maggot! I'll stove your head in!! [lunges at Sméagol, but Frodo restrains him] Call me a liar?! You're a liar!

Frodo Baggins:
You scare him off, we're lost!

Samwise:
I don't care! I can't do it, Mr. Frodo, I won't wait around for him to kill us!

Frodo Baggins:
I'm not sending him away.

Samwise Gamgee:
You don't see it, do you? He's a damn villain.

Frodo Baggins:
We can't do this by ourselves, Sam. Not without a guide. I need you on my side.

Samwise Gamgee:
I'm on your side, Mr. Frodo.

Frodo Baggins:
I know, Sam. I know. Trust me. Come, Sméagol. [Smeagol follows Frodo and looks at Sam; Gollum grins evilly at Sam]

[Extended edition only]

Samwise Gamgee:
Must be getting near teatime. Leastways it would be in decent places where there is still teatime.

Sméagol:
We're not in decent places.

[Sam turns back to Frodo, who has paused suddenly]

Samwise Gamgee:
Mr. Frodo? What is it?

Frodo Baggins:
It's just a feeling. I don't think I'll be coming back.

Samwise Gamgee:
Yes, you will. Of course you will. That's just morbid thinking. We're going there and back again, just like Mr. Bilbo. You'll see.

Faramir:
Mithrandir! They broke through our defenses! They've taken the bridge and the west bank. Battalions of Orcs are crossing the river.

Irolas:
It is as the Lord Denethor predicted. Long has he foreseen this doom.

Gandalf:
Foreseen and done nothing!

[Faramir stares at Pippin]

Gandalf:
Faramir? This is not the first halfling to have crossed your path.

Faramir:
No.

Pippin:
You've seen Frodo and Sam?

[Faramir nods, both Gandalf and Pippin show a sign of relief]

Gandalf:
Where? When?

Faramir:
In Ithilien. Not two days ago. Gandalf, they're taking the road to the Morgul Vale.

Gandalf:
And then the pass of Cirith Ungol.

Pippin:
What does that mean? What's wrong?

Gandalf:
Faramir, tell me everything.

Gothmog:
[as the Orcs retreat from Minas Tirith's gate] What are you doing, you useless scum?!

Orc Captain:
The door won't give! It's too strong!

Gothmog:
Get back there, and smash it down!

Orc Captain:
But nothing can breach it!

Gothmog:
[smiles] Grond will breach it. Bring up the Wolf's Head!

[extended scene]

Gandalf:
Go back to the Abyss! Fall into the nothingness that awaits you and your master!

Witch-King:
Do you not know death when you see it, old man?! [Pippin screams] This is MY hour!

[At this point, the Witch-king draws his sword and holds it aloft; the blade is enclosed in a fiery vortex. Gandalf's staff shatters. Gandalf falls off Shadowfax]

Pippin:
Gandalf! [the Witch King looms over Gandalf. An enraged Pippin draws his sword to intervene but the Witch King's fell beast roars at him, paralysing the Hobbit in terror]

Witch-King:
You have failed. The world of Men will fall.

[As the Witch King pulls back his sword for the death blow, a horn blows in the distance; the army of Rohan has arrived. With a shriek of fury, the Witch King departs to confront the new threat]

Gimli:
[after Aragorn kills the envoy at the Black Gate; extended edition only] I guess that concludes negotiations...

Gollum:
Naughty little fly! Why does it cry? Caught in a web! Soon you'll be... eaten.

Gollum:
Clever hobbits to climb so high!

Samwise Gamgee:
[to Frodo in Mount Doom] Don't you let go! Don't let go! Reach!

Samwise Gamgee:
Well, I'm back.

Legolas:
[talking to Aragorn] The stars are veiled. Something stirs in the East, a sleepless malice...The Eye of the Enemy is moving. [reacts with horror as he senses Pippin looking into the Palantir] He is here!

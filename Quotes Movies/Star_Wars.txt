Darth Vader:
I have you now!

General Tagge:
What of the Rebellion? If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical reading of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, they might find a weakness and exploit it.

Darth Vader:
The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.

Admiral Motti:
Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they have obtained. This station is now the ultimate power in the universe. I suggest we use it.

Imperial Officer:
Where are you taking this... thing?

Governor Tarkin:
Obi-Wan Kenobi?

Darth Vader:
He is here.

Governor Tarkin:
What makes you think so?

Darth Vader:
A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.

Governor Tarkin:
Surely he must be dead by now.

Darth Vader:
Don't underestimate the Force.

Princess Leia:
I don't know who you are or where you've come from, but from now on you'll do as I say, okay?

Obi-Wan:
That's no moon. It's Doctor Michael Morbius, at your service.

Luke:
Listen, I can't get involved. I've got work to do. It's not that I like the Empire; I hate it. But there's nothing I can do about it right now... It's all such a long way from here.

Obi-Wan:
That's your uncle talking.

Obi-Wan:
The Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together.

Han Solo:
Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs. I told you I'd outrun 'em.

Han Solo:
Don't everyone thank me at once.

Han Solo:
Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.

Governor Tarkin:
The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us. I have just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently. The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away.

General Tagge:
But that's impossible. How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?

Governor Tarkin:
The regional governors now have direct control over their territories. Fear will keep the local systems in line. Fear of this battle station.

Luke:
I'm Luke Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you.

Princess Leia:
You're who?

C-3PO:
We seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in life.

Princess Leia:
General Kenobi: Years ago, you served my father in the Clone Wars; now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire. I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person; but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to Alderaan has failed. I've placed information vital to the survival of the rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit. My father will know how to retrieve it. You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan. This is our most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi; you're my only hope.

Princess Leia:
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi; you're my only hope.

Obi-Wan:
I have something here for you. Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it. He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damn fool idealistic crusade like your father did. It's your father's lightsaber. This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster, but an elegant weapon for a more civilized age. For over a thousand generations, the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic. Before the dark times, before the Empire.

Luke:
How did my father die?

Obi-Wan:
A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi knights. He betrayed and murdered your father.

Obi-Wan:
Mos Eisley spaceport. You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious.

Luke:
I don't understand how we got by those troops. I thought we were dead.

Obi-Wan:
The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded.

Han Solo:
Han Solo. I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon. Chewie here tells me you're lookin' for passage to the Alderaan system?

Obi-Wan:
Yes indeed, if it's a fast ship.

Han Solo:
Fast ship? You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?

Han Solo:
Stay sharp. There's two more coming in. They'll try and cut us off.

Luke:
Why don't you outrun them? I thought you said this thing was fast.

Han Solo:
Watch your mouth kid, or you're gonna find yourself floating home. We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose em'!

Han Solo:
Here's where the fun begins!

Obi-Wan:
How long before you can make the jump to light speed?

Han Solo:
It'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.

Luke:
Are you kidding? At the rate they're gaining...

Han Solo:
Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!

Darth Vader:
I find your lack of faith disturbing.

Darth Vader:
Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.

Princess Leia:
Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash. I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board.

Governor Tarkin:
Charming to the last. You don't know how hard I found it, signing the order to terminate your life.

Princess Leia:
I'm surprised that you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.

Governor Tarkin:
Princess Leia, before your execution, you will join me at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational. No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now.

Princess Leia:
The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.

C-3PO:
Listen to them, they're dying, R2. Curse my metal body. I wasn't fast enough. It's all my fault. My poor master.

Governor Tarkin:
If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape.

Darth Vader:
Escape is not his plan. I must face him. Alone.

Darth Vader:
I sense something. A presence I've not felt since...

Obi-Wan:
Luke, there was nothing you could have done, had you been there. You would have been killed, too, and the droids would now be in the hands of the Empire.

Luke:
I want to come with you to Alderaan. There is nothing here for me now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father.

C-3PO:
Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease.

C-3PO:
We're doomed.

Han Solo:
Wonderful girl. Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.

Han Solo:
Damn fool, I knew you were going to say that.

Obi-Wan:
Who's the more foolish: The fool, or the fool who follows it?

Han Solo:
Traveling through hyperspace ain't like dusting crops, boy.

Princess Leia:
Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper?

Han Solo:
Get in there you big furry oaf. I don't care what you smell.

Han Solo:
This is not going to work.

Luke:
Why didn't you say so before?

Han Solo:
I did say so before.

Han Solo:
Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight. I take orders from just one person: me.

Princess Leia:
It's a wonder you're still alive.

Princess Leia:
Will someone get this big walking carpet out of my way?

Han Solo:
No reward is worth this.

Princess Leia:
You came in that thing? You're braver than I thought.

Luke:
Got 'im! I got 'im!

Han Solo:
Great, kid. Don't get cocky.

Princess Leia:
If money is all you love, then that's what you'll receive.

Luke:
So... you got your reward and you're just leaving then?

Han Solo:
That's right, yeah. I got some old debts I've got to pay off with this stuff. Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to stick around here, do you? Why don't you come with us? You're pretty good in a fight. We could use you.

Luke:
Come on. Why don't you take a look around? You know what's about to happen, what they're up against. They could use a good pilot like you. You're turning your back on them.

Han Solo:
What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like... suicide.

Luke:
All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, isn't it?

Han Solo:
Hey, Luke... may the Force be with you.

Han Solo:
What're you lookin' at? I know what I'm doin'.

Darth Vader:
The Force is strong with this one.

Darth Vader:
Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans! And bring me the passengers! I want them alive!

Princess Leia:
Darth Vader. Only you could be so bold.

Chewbacca:
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrgh

C-3PO:
He made a fair move. Screaming about it can't help you.

Han Solo:
Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.

C-3PO:
But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.

Han Solo:
That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their sockets when they lose. Wookiees are known to do that.

Chewbacca:
Grrf.

C-3PO:
I see your point, sir. I suggest a new strategy, R2: let the Wookiee win.

Darth Vader:
I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan. We meet again, at last. The circle is now complete. When I left you I was but the learner. Now, I am the master.

Obi-Wan:
Only a master of evil, Darth.

Darth Vader:
Your powers are weak, old man.

Obi-Wan:
You can't win, Darth. If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.

Darth Vader:
You should not have come back.

Han Solo:
Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh? You know, sometimes I amaze even myself.

Princess Leia:
That doesn't sound too hard.

Darth Vader:
Your powers are weak, old man.

Obi-Wan:
You can't win, Darth. If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you could possibly imagine.

Obi-Wan:
The Force will be with you, always.

Luke:
I used to bullseye womp rats in my T-16 back home. They're not much bigger than two meters.

Wedge Antilles (Red 2):
Look at the size of that thing.

Red Leader:
Cut the chatter, Red 2.

Commander #1:
We've analyzed their attack, sir, and there is a danger. Should I have your ship standing by?

Governor Tarkin:
Evacuate? In our moment of triumph? I think you overestimate their chances.

Obi-Wan:
Use the Force, Luke.

Luke:
I have a very bad feeling about this.

Luke:
You know, between his howling and you blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here.

Han Solo:
Bring 'em on, I'd prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.

Han Solo:
Where did you dig up that old fossil?

Luke:
Ben is a great man.

Han Solo:
Yeah, great at getting us into trouble.

Princess Leia:
Your friend is quite a mercenary. I wonder if he really cares about anything... or anybody.

Luke:
I care.

C-3PO:
Is there anything I can do?

Luke:
Not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest or teleport me off this rock.

Princess Leia:
Into the garbage chute, flyboy.

Luke:
I'm not such a bad pilot myself.

Obi-Wan:
In my experience, there's no such thing as luck.

Luke:
Hey Biggs, I told you I'd make it.

Biggs:
It'll be like old times, they'll never stop us.

C-3PO:
Help. I think I'm melting. This is all your fault.

C-3PO:
Master Luke, sir. Pardon me for asking, but what should R2 and I do if we're discovered here?

Luke:
Lock the door.

Han Solo:
And hope they don't have blasters.

C-3PO:
That isn't very reassuring.

Uncle Owen:
Have you seen Luke this morning?

Aunt Beru:
He said that he had some things to do before he started, so he left early.

Uncle Owen:
Did he take those two new droids with him?

Aunt Beru:
I think so.

Uncle Owen:
Well, he'd better have those units in the South Ridge repaired by midday, or there'll be hell to pay.

Han Solo:
YAHOOOOO! You're all clear, kid. Now let's blow this thing and go home.

Princess Leia:
They let us go. It was the only reason for the ease of our escape.

Han Solo:
Easy? You call that easy?

Princess Leia:
They're tracking us.

Han Solo:
Not this ship, sister.

Princess Leia:
Well, at least the information in R2 is still intact.

Han Solo:
What's so important? What's he carrying?

Darth Vader:
Today will be a day long remembered. It has seen the death of Kenobi, and will soon see the end of the Rebellion.

Obi-Wan:
I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.

Luke:
What are you doing hiding back there?

C-3PO:
It wasn't my fault, sir, please don't deactivate me. I told R2-D2 not to go but he's faulty, malfunctioning. 'Kept babbling on about his mission.

Luke:
It's a good thing you have these compartments.

Han Solo:
Yeah, I use them for smuggling. I'd never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them.

Han Solo:
One thing's for sure, we're all gonna be a lot thinner.

C-3PO:
I've just about had enough of you. Go that way. You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you near-sighted scrap pile. And don't let me catch you following me begging for help because you won't get it.

C-3PO:
That malfunctioning little twirp, this is all his fault.

Princess Leia:
I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan...

Darth Vader:
You are part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away!

Governor Tarkin:
Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion.

Darth Vader:
What do you mean?

Governor Tarkin:
I think it is time we'd demonstrated the full power of this station. Set course for Alderaan.

Governor Tarkin:
The Jedi are extinct. Their fire has gone out of the universe.

Darth Vader:
And now, your highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden rebel base...

Darth Vader:
I will take them myself. Cover me.

Han Solo:
What kept you?

Princess Leia:
We ran into some old friends.

Imperial Officer:
We count 30 rebel ships, lord Vader, but they are so small they're evading our turbo lasers.

Darth Vader:
We'll have to destroy them ship to ship. Get the crews to their fighters.

Governor Tarkin:
Are they away?

Darth Vader:
They just made the jump into hyperspace.

Governor Tarkin:
And you're sure the homing beacon is secure onboard their ship? I'm taking an awful risk, Vader. This had better work.

Princess Leia:
The Imperial Senate will not sit still for this. When they hear you've attacked a diplomatic...

Darth Vader:
Don't act so surprised, your highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.

Han Solo:
What an incredible smell you've discovered! Let's get out of here! Get away from there...

Luke:
No! Wait!

Luke:
Will you forget it? I already tried it. It's magnetically sealed!

Princess Leia:
Put that thing away, you're gonna get us all killed!

Han Solo:
Absolutely, Your Worship. Look, I had everything under control until you led us down here! It's not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us.

Princess Leia:
It could've been worse.

Han Solo:
It's worse.

Governor Tarkin:
Yes?

Darth Vader:
They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess. She may yet be of some use to us.

Princess Leia:
For luck.

Red Six:
I got a problem here.

Biggs:
Eject!

Red Six:
I can hold it.

Biggs:
Pull up!

Red Six:
No, I'm all right... ahhh!

Princess Leia:
It seems like you've managed to cut of our only escape route.

Han Solo:
Maybe you would like it back in your cell, your highness?

Princess Leia:
He certainly has courage...

Luke:
Yeah, but what good will it do us if he gets himself killed? Come on!

C-3PO:
Did You hear that? They shut down the main reactor. We'll be destroyed for sure. This is madness.

C-3PO:
You must repair him! Sir, if any of my circuits or gears will help, I'll gladly donate them.

Luke:
He'll be all right.

Darth Vader:
You should not have come back!

Han Solo:
Good against remotes is one thing. Good against the living, that's something else.

Han Solo:
What an incredible smell you've discovered!

Princess Leia:
This some rescue. What, you came in here, you don't have a plan for getting out?

Obi Wan Kenobi:
That's no moon, it's a space station.

Han Solo,  I love you!

Princess Leia, I know

[R2-D2 abruptly begins playing Leia's holographic message at Ben Kenobi's house]

Luke Skywalker:
I saw part of the message he was...

Obi-Wan Kenobi:
I seem to have found it.

Princess Leia Organa:
[in a hologram message] General Kenobi. Years ago, you served my father in the Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire. I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed. I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit. My father will know how to retrieve it. You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan. This is our most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. [looks to the side quickly, then crouches to end the message]

Obi-Wan:
[to Luke] You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan.

Luke:
Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.

Obi-Wan:
I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.

Luke:
Listen, I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.

Obi-Wan:
That's your uncle talking.

Luke:
Oh, boy, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this?

Obi-Wan:
[pleading] Learn about the Force, Luke.

Luke:
Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.

Obi-Wan:
[resigned] You must do what you feel is right, of course.

Cassio Tagge:
Until this battle station is fully operational, we are vulnerable. The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped. They're more dangerous than you realize!

Conan Antonio Motti:
Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander. Not to this battle station.

Tagge:
The Rebellion will continue to gain a support in the Imperial Senate, until...

Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin:
[walking in with Darth Vader] The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us. I have just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently. The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away.

Tagge:
That's impossible! How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?

Tarkin:
The regional governors now have direct control over their territories. Fear will keep the local systems in line. Fear of this battle station.

Tagge:
And what of the Rebellion? If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible — however unlikely — that they might find a weakness and exploit it.

Darth Vader:
The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.

Motti:
Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained. This station is now the ultimate power in the universe! I suggest we use it.

Vader:
Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.

Motti:
Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader. [Vader walks toward Motti, then slowly raises his hand] Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebels' hidden fortr–– [grasps his throat as if he is being choked]

Vader:
I find your lack of faith disturbing.

Tarkin:
Enough of this. Vader, release him!

Vader:
As you wish. [drops his hand and Motti's head hits the table as he regains his breath]

Tarkin:
This bickering is pointless. Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the Rebel fortress by the time this station is operational. We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke.

(Han is about to leave the cantina to inform Jabba he'll be getting his money soon enough when Greedo intercepts him)

Greedo:
(in Huttese) Going somewhere, Solo?

Han Solo:
Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss. Tell Jabba that I've got his money.

Greedo:
It's too late. You should've paid him when you had the chance. Jabba's put a price on your head so large that every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you. I'm lucky I found you first.

Han:
Yeah, but this time I've got the money.

Greedo:
If you give it to me, I might forget that I found you.

Han:
I don't have it with me. Tell Jabba—

Greedo:
Jabba's through with you. He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser.

Han:
Even I get boarded sometimes. Did you think I had a choice?

Greedo:
You can tell that to Jabba. He may only take your ship.

Han:
Over my dead body.

Greedo:
That's the idea. I've been looking forward to this for a long time.

Han:
Yes, I'll bet you have. (blasts Greedo from under the table with his laser pistol, killing him instantly, then gets up from the table and pays the bartender as he leaves the Cantina) Sorry about the mess.

(Han arrives at Docking Bay 94 and sees a familiar face)

Jabba the Hutt:
(in Huttese) Solo! Come out of there, Solo! Solo!

Han Solo:
Right here, Jabba. (Jabba and his henchmen turn around to see Han and Chewbacca) I've been waiting for you.

Jabba:
Have you now.

Han:
You didn't think I was gonna run, did you?

Jabba:
Han, my boy, you disappoint me. Why haven't you paid me? And why did you fry poor Greedo?

Han:
Look, Jabba, next time you wanna talk to me, come see me yourself. Don't send one of these twerps.

Jabba:
Han, I can't make exceptions. What if everyone who smuggled for me dropped their cargo at the first sign of an Imperial starship? It's not good business.

Han:
Look, Jabba, even I get boarded sometimes. (steps on Jabba's tail, causing him to yelp in pain) Did you think I had a choice? But I got a nice easy charter now; I'll pay you back, plus a little extra. I just need a little more time.

Jabba:
Han, my boy, you're the best smuggler I ever hired. So, for an extra 20%...

Han:
15, Jabba, and don't push it.

Jabba:
Okay, 15%. But if you fail me again, I'll put a price on your head so big, you won't be able to go near a civilized system.

Han:
Jabba, you're a wonderful human being.

Jabba:
(orders minions) Come on. (Jabba's gang leaves with bounty hunter Boba Fett following behind.)

Leia:
Governor Tarkin. I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash. I recognized your foul stench when I was brought onboard.

Tarkin:
Charming to the last. You don't know how hard I found it, signing the order to terminate your life.

Leia:
[sarcastically] I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.

Tarkin:
Princess Leia, before your execution, I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational. No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now.

Leia:
The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.

Tarkin:
Not after we demonstrate the power of this station. In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that will be destroyed first. Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power on your home planet of Alderaan.

Leia:
[shocked] No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly–

Tarkin:
You'd prefer another target? A military target?! Then name the system! [stepping closer to Leia and pinning her against Darth Vader] I grow tired of asking this, so it will be the last time. Where is the Rebel base?

Leia:
[looks at Alderaan for a moment, then, resigned] Dantooine. They're on Dantooine.

Tarkin:
There. You see, Lord Vader? She can be reasonable. [to assistant] Continue with the operation. You may fire when ready.

Leia:
[panicked] What?!

Tarkin:
You are far too trusting. Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration, but don't worry. We will deal with your rebel friends soon enough.

Leia:
No!

Officer:
Commence primary ignition.

[Leia watches in horror as the Death Star fires and destroys Alderaan]

[Luke is training with his lightsaber and a laser remote aboard the Millennium Falcon]

Obi-Wan:
Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.

Luke:
You mean it controls your actions?

Obi-Wan:
Partially, but it also obeys your commands.

[Luke gets shot by the remote]

Han:
[laughs] Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.

Luke:
You don't believe in the Force, do you?

Han:
Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. [Kenobi smiles] Anyway, it's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.

Obi-Wan:
[gets up and takes a blast helmet] I suggest you try it again, Luke. Only this time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. [puts the helmet on Luke, which covers his eyes]

Luke:
But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight?

Obi-Wan:
Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. [remote shoots Luke] Stretch out with your feelings! [Watches Luke succeed in blocking the lasers] You see? You can do it.

Han:
I call it luck.

Obi-Wan:
In my experience, there is no such thing as luck.

Vader:
He is here.

Tarkin:
Obi-Wan Kenobi? What makes you think so?

Vader:
A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.

Tarkin:
Surely he must be dead by now.

Vader:
Don't underestimate the Force.

Tarkin:
The Jedi are extinct. Their fire has gone out of the universe. You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion. [An intercom beeps, which Tarkin answers] Yes?

Intercom:
We have an emergency alert in detention block AA23.

Tarkin:
The Princess? Put all sections on alert!

Vader:
Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.

Tarkin:
If you are right, he must not be allowed to escape.

Vader:
Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone.

[Luke's X-wing is in the trench, and Darth Vader is having trouble getting a lock]

Vader:
[Gets a lock] I have you now. [Suddenly, one of Vader's escorts is destroyed.] What?!

Han:
YEAH-HOO!!! [The Millennium Falcon arrives on the scene.]

Vader's Escort:
Look out! [Vader's surviving escort panics and crashes into the trench, and Vader's TIE Advanced is flung out into space]

Han:
You're all clear, kid! Now let's blow this thing and go home! [Luke shoots at the exhaust port and with the help of the Force]

Officer:
Stand by.

[The Rebels and the Millennium Falcon fly back to Yavin 4]

Officer:
Stand by.

[Just as the Death Star is about to fire, it explodes]

Han:
Great shot, kid! That was one in a million!

Obi-Wan:
Remember... the Force will be with you, always.

Obi-Wan Kenobi:

Well of course I know him, he’s me.

Fear leads to anger anger leads to hate hate leads to suffering

Do some of that pilot sh!t Mav

You came in that thing? You’re braver than I thought.

Opening Crawl: It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire.

Opening crawl:
Luke Skywalker has returned to his home planet of Tatooine in an attempt to rescue his friend Han Solo from the clutches of the vile gangster Jabba the Hutt. Little does Luke know that the GALACTIC EMPIRE has secretly begun construction on a new armored space station even more powerful than the first dreaded Death Star. When completed, this ultimate weapon will spell certain doom for the small band of rebels struggling to restore freedom to the galaxy...

[Darth Vader steps out of his shuttle on the Death Star.]

Moff Jerjerrod:
Lord Vader. This is an unexpected pleasure. We are honored by your presence.

Darth Vader:
You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I am here to put you back on schedule.

Jerjerrod:
I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast they can.

Vader:
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.

Jerjerrod:
I tell you that this station will be operational as planned.

Vader:
The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.

Jerjerrod:
But he asks the impossible! I need more men!

Vader:
Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.

Jerjerrod:
[alarmed] The Emperor's coming here?

Vader:
That is correct, Commander, and he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress.

Jerjerrod:
We shall double our efforts.

Vader:
I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am.

[Jabba the Hutt and his entourage catch Leia rescuing Han]

Han Solo:
Hey, Jabba. Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay you back, but I got a little sidetracked! It's not my fault...

Jabba the Hutt:
[in Huttese] It's too late for that, Solo. You may have been a good smuggler in the business, but now you're Bantha fodder!

Solo:
Look...

Jabba:
[to guards] Take him away!

Solo:
[being dragged away by the guards] Jabba... I'll pay you triple! You're throwing away a fortune here! Don't be a fool!

Jabba:
[sees Leia being led away by Lando in disguise] Wait! Bring her to me.

Princess Leia Organa:
[brought to Jabba] We have powerful friends. You're gonna regret this.

Jabba:
[grinning] Of that, I'm sure. But, in the meantime, I shall thoroughly enjoy the pleasure of your company. [licks his lips] Leia...

Princess Leia Organa:
[seeing Jabba's tongue before her face, turns away in disgust] Ugh!

C-3PO:
Oh, I can't bear to watch!

[Emperor Palpatine has arrived on the Death Star.]

Emperor Palpatine:
[to a kneeling Vader] Rise, my friend.

Darth Vader:
The Death Star will be completed on schedule.

Palpatine:
You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.

Vader:
Yes, my Master.

Palpatine:
Patience, my friend. In time, he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.

Vader:
As you wish.

Palpatine:
Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen. [laughs wickedly]

[Luke is in Yoda's hut. Yoda is pacing back and forth. Luke is looking at him with a mixture of sadness and pity.]

Yoda:
That face, you make. Look I so old to young eyes?

Luke:
[hurriedly] No! Of course not.

Yoda:
[chuckles good-naturedly] I do. Yes, I do. Hmm, sick, have I become. Old and weak. [Points at Luke] When 900 years old, you reach, look as good, you will not, hmm? [Laughs again, coughs, walks over to his bed]. Soon, will I rest, yes. Forever sleep. Earned it, I have. [Climbs into his bed]

Luke:
Master Yoda, you can't die.

Yoda:
Strong, am I with the Force...but not that strong. Twilight is upon me, and soon night must fall. That is the way of things...the way of the Force.

Luke:
But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.

Yoda:
No more training, do you require. Already know you that which you need.

Luke:
Then I am a Jedi.

Yoda:
[coughs trying to speak] Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must...confront...Vader. Then, only then, a Jedi, will you be. And confront him, you will.

Luke:
[visibly in agony] Master Yoda...is Darth Vader my father?

Yoda:
[turns away from Luke] Rest, I need. Yes, rest.

Luke:
[pleading] Yoda, I must know.

Yoda:
Your father, he is. [Luke looks away] Told you, did he?

Luke:
Yes.

Yoda:
Unexpected, this is, and unfortunate.

Luke:
[surprised] Unfortunate that I know the truth?

Yoda:
No. [turns to face Luke] Unfortunate that you rushed to face him. That incomplete, was your training. That not ready for the burden, were you.

Luke:
I'm sorry.

Yoda:
[strains to speak as voice gradually grows softer] Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware: Anger, fear, aggression - the dark side, are they. Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny. [Whispering now] Luke...Luke...do not... [Struggles to speak] Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor...or suffer your father's fate you will. Luke...[Luke leans in close]...when gone am I, the last of the Jedi, will you be. Luke...the Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned. Luke...[with great effort]...There...is...another...Sk...Sky...walker...[Yoda dies]

[Yoda has passed into The Force, Luke is sitting outside his hut with R2]

Luke:
I can't do it, R2. I can't go on alone.

Obi-Wan Kenobi:
[voice emanates from nowhere] Yoda will always be with you. [reveals himself as a spirit walking nearby]

Luke:
Obi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me? You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.

Obi-Wan:
Your father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I told you was true, from a certain point of view.

Luke:
[incredulously] A certain point of view?

Obi-Wan:
Luke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view. Anakin was a good friend. When I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him. I took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi. I thought that I could instruct him just as well as Yoda. I was wrong.

Luke:
There is still good in him.

Obi-Wan:
He's more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.

Luke:
I can't do it, Ben.

Obi-Wan:
You cannot escape your destiny. You must face Darth Vader again.

Luke:
I can't kill my own father!

Obi-Wan:
[resigned] Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.

Luke:
Yoda spoke of another.

Obi-Wan:
The other he spoke of is your twin sister.

Luke:
But I have no sister.

Obi-Wan:
[nods] Mm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did. If Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.

Luke:
[with sudden realization] Leia! Leia's my sister!

Obi-Wan:
Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit, but they could be made to serve the Emperor.

[Luke has stepped out of the Ewok party. Leia joins him.]

Princess Leia Organa:
Luke, what's wrong?

Luke:
Leia, do you remember your mother? Your real mother?

Leia:
Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.

Luke:
What do you remember?

Leia:
Just images, really. Feelings.

Luke:
Tell me.

Leia:
She was very beautiful. Kind, but sad. Why are you asking me all this?

Luke:
I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.

Leia:
Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?

Luke:
Vader's here. Now, on this moon.

Leia:
How do you know?

Luke:
I felt his presence. He's come for me. He can feel when I'm near. That's why I have to go. As long as I stay, I'm endangering the group and our mission here. I have to face him.

Leia:
Why?

Luke:
He's my father.

Leia:
[shocked] Your father?!

Luke:
There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance.

Leia:
Luke, don't talk that way! You have a power I don't understand and could never have.

Luke:
You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it. I have it and... [looks directly at Leia] My sister has it. [waits for the words to sink in] Yes. It's you, Leia.

Leia:
[astonished] I know. Somehow, I've always known.

Luke:
Then you know why I have to face him.

Leia:
No! Luke, run away, far away! If he can feel your presence, then leave this place! I wish I could go with you.

Luke:
No, you don't. You've always been strong.

Leia:
But why must you confront him?

Luke:
Because there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try. [kisses Leia on the cheek, then leaves]

Han:
[seeing Luke leave] Hey, what's goin' on?

Leia:
Nothing. I just want to be alone for a little while.

Han:
Nothing? Come on, tell me. What's goin' on?

Leia:
[distressed] I... I can't tell you!

Han:
[angrily] What, could you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell?

Leia:
[crying] I- [turns away from Han]

Han:
[grunts angrily and starts to storm away, but stops and returns to Leia a moment later] I'm sorry.

Leia:
[leaning against Han] Hold me.

[Luke surrenders himself to Darth Vader.]

Darth Vader:
The Emperor has been expecting you.

Luke Skywalker:
I know, father.

Vader:
So, you have accepted the truth.

Luke:
I've accepted the truth that you were once Anakin Skywalker, my father.

Vader:
[angry retort] That name no longer has any meaning for me.

Luke:
It is the name of your true self. You've only forgotten. I know there is good in you. The Emperor hasn't driven it from you fully. [steps off to the side of the passageway, away from Vader] That was why you couldn't destroy me. That's why you won't bring me to your Emperor now.

Vader:
[inspects Luke's lightsaber] I see you have constructed a new lightsaber. Your skills are complete. [turns off the lightsaber again] Indeed you are powerful, as the Emperor has foreseen.

Luke:
Come with me.

Vader:
Obi-Wan once thought as you do. You don't know the power of the dark side! I must obey my master.

Luke:
I will not turn. And you'll be forced to kill me.

Vader:
If that is your destiny.

Luke:
Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you! Let go of your hate!

Vader:
It is... too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now.

Luke:
[resigned] Then my father is truly dead.

Emperor Palpatine:
Welcome, young Skywalker, I have been expecting you. You no longer need those. [uses the Force to detach Luke's cuffs] Guards, leave us. [the Emperor's guards leave the room] I'm looking forward to completing your training. In time, you will call me master.

Luke Skywalker:
You're gravely mistaken. You won't convert me as you did my father.

Palpatine:
Oh no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken. About a great many things.

Darth Vader:
[hands Luke's lightsaber to Palpatine] His lightsaber.

Palpatine:
Ah, yes, a Jedi's weapon, much like your father's. By now you must know that your father can never be turned from the dark side. So will it be with you.

Luke:
You're wrong. Soon I'll be dead, and you with me.

Palpatine:
[laughing] Perhaps you refer to the imminent attack of your Rebel fleet? Yes, I assure you, we are quite safe from your friends here.

Luke:
Your overconfidence is your weakness.

Palpatine:
[looks back at Luke] Your faith in your friends is yours.

Vader:
It is pointless to resist, my son.

Palpatine:
Everything that has transpired has done so, according to my design. Your friends, out there on the sanctuary moon, are walking into a trap, as is your Rebel fleet. It was I who allowed the Alliance to know the location of the shield generator. It is quite safe from your pitiful little band. An entire legion of my best troops awaits them. [mockingly] Oh, I'm afraid the deflector shield will be quite operational when your friends arrive.

Darth Vader:
[searching for Luke in Palpatine's chamber] You cannot hide forever, Luke.

Luke Skywalker:
I will not fight you.

Vader:
Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for... [pauses] Sister. So, you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will.

Luke:
[revealing himself] NEVER!!!!! [attacks Vader ferociously, eventually backing him onto a railing and cutting off his arm. He stands over Vader for a moment.]

Emperor Palpatine:
[laughing] Good! Your hate has made you powerful. Now, fulfill your destiny and take your father's place at my side!

Luke:
[looks at Vader's severed hand, then turns to face the Emperor, throwing away his lightsaber] Never. I'll never turn to the Dark Side. You have failed, Your Highness. I am a Jedi, like my father before me.

[Pause]

Palpatine:
[angrily] So be it... Jedi.

[Luke refuses to give in to Palpatine's demands and disarms himself.]

Palpatine:
[raising his hands toward Luke] If you will not be turned, you will be destroyed. [Fires lightning bolts at Luke, causing him to fall to the floor in agony. Darth Vader gets up and stands next to Palpatine, watching.] Young fool. Only now, at the end, do you understand. [shoots another round of lightning] Your feeble skills are no match for the power of the Dark Side. You have paid the price for your lack of vision. [continues shooting lightning]

Luke:
[writhing in agony] Father, please! Help me!

Palpatine:
Now, young Skywalker... you will die. [intensifies lightning blasts]

Darth Vader/Anakin Skywalker:
[looks back and forth at Luke and Palpatine] No. NOOOOOO!!!!!!! [grabs Palpatine from behind and throws him down into the reactor shaft]

[A redeemed Anakin Skywalker is dying in Luke's arms]

Anakin Skywalker:
Luke, help me take this mask off.

Luke:
But you'll die!

Anakin:
Nothing can stop that now. Just for once, let me look on you with my own eyes. [Luke carefully removes Vader's mask to reveal Anakin's disfigured face underneath.] Now...go, my son. Leave me.

Luke:
No, you're coming with me. I won't leave you here. I've got to save you!

Anakin:
[smiles] You already have, Luke. You were right. You were right about me... Tell your sister... you were right... [dies]

Luke:
Father... I won't leave you.

Return To A Galaxy... Far, Far Away

The saga continues.......

The Empire Falls....


Opening crawl:
It is a dark time for the Rebellion. Although the Death Star has been destroyed, Imperial troops have driven the Rebel forces from their hidden base and pursued them across the galaxy. Evading the dreaded Imperial Starfleet, a group of freedom fighters led by Luke Skywalker have established a new secret base on the remote ice world of Hoth. The evil lord Darth Vader, obsessed with finding young Skywalker, has dispatched thousands of remote probes into the far reaches of space....

Yoda:
Yes, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware of the dark side. Anger, fear, aggression - the dark side of the Force, are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny. Consume you, it will, as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice.

[Luke is stranded out in a harsh snowstorm.]

Obi-Wan Kenobi:
[voice comes out of nowhere] Luke. Luke!

Luke Skywalker:
[weakly] Ben?

Obi-Wan:
You will go to the Dagobah system.

Luke :
Dagobah system?

Obi-Wan:
There you will learn from Yoda, the Jedi Master who instructed me.

[Aboard the Super Star Destroyer Executor, Captain Firmus Piett reports to Admiral Kendal Ozzel.]

Capt. Firmus Piett:
Admiral.

Adm. Kendal Ozzel:
Yes, Captain?

Piett:
I think we've got something, sir. The report is only a fragment, from a probe droid in the Hoth system, but it's the best lead we have.

Ozzel:
[growing impatient] We have thousands of probe droids searching the galaxy. I want proof, not leads.

Piett:
The visuals indicate life readings.

Ozzel:
It could mean anything. If we followed up every lead...

Piett:
But sir, the Hoth system is supposed to be devoid of human forms.

Darth Vader:
[approaching the two officers after hearing their conversation] You've found something?

Piett:
Yes, my Lord. [shows Vader the location of the power generator on Hoth]

Darth Vader:
That's it. The Rebels are there.

Ozzel:
[annoyed] My Lord, there are so many uncharted settlements. It could be smugglers; it could be pirates; it could be...

Darth Vader:
That is the system. And I am sure Skywalker is with them. Set your course for the Hoth system! [turns to General Maximilian Veers] General Veers, prepare your men!

[Darth Vader emerges from an egg-like meditation chamber to receive a report from General Maximilian Veers.]

Darth Vader:
What is it, General?

Gen. Maximilian Veers:
My Lord, the fleet has moved out of lightspeed. Com-Scan has detected an energy field protecting an area of the sixth planet of the Hoth system. The field is strong enough to deflect any bombardment.

Darth Vader:
[Angrily] The Rebels are alerted to our presence. Admiral Ozzel came out of lightspeed too close to the system.

Veers:
He felt surprise was wiser-

Darth Vader:
He is as clumsy as he is stupid. General, prepare your troops for a surface attack.

Veers:
Yes, my Lord. [bows and leaves quickly]

[Darth Vader turns to a nearby screen and calls up Admiral Kendal Ozzel and Captain Firmus Piett.]

Adm. Kendal Ozzel:
Lord Vader, the fleet has moved out of lightspeed and we're preparing to- [begins choking]

Darth Vader:
You have failed me for the last time, Admiral. Captain Piett.

Capt. Firmus Piett:
[nervously] Yes, my Lord?

Darth Vader:
Make ready to land our troops beyond their energy field, then deploy the fleet so that nothing gets off the system. You are in command now, ADMIRAL Piett.

Piett:
[sees a dead Ozzel collapse] Thank you, Lord Vader.

Darth Vader:
[kneeling before Emperor Palpatine's hologram] What is thy bidding, my master?

Emperor Palpatine:
There is a great disturbance in the Force.

Vader:
I have felt it.

Palpatine:
We have a new enemy. The young Rebel who destroyed the Death Star. I have no doubt this boy is the offspring of Anakin Skywalker.

Vader:
How is that possible?

Palpatine:
Search your feelings, Lord Vader. You will know it to be true. He could destroy us.

Vader:
He's just a boy. Obi-Wan can no longer help him.

Palpatine:
The Force is strong with him. The son of Skywalker must not become a Jedi.

Vader:
If he could be turned, he would become a powerful ally.

Palpatine:
[intrigued] Yes... He would be a great asset. Can it be done?

Vader:
He will join us or die, master.

[Luke sees his X-Wing is about to sink into the bog]

Luke Skywalker:
Oh, no! We'll never get it out now!

Yoda:
So certain, are you? Always with you, it cannot be done. Hear you nothing that I say?

Luke:
Master, moving stones around is one thing, but this is... totally different!

Yoda:
No! No different! Only different in your mind. You must unlearn what you have learned.

Luke:
All right, I'll give it a try.

Yoda:
No! Try not. Do... or do not. There is no try.

[Luke tries to use the Force to levitate his X-Wing out of the bog, but fails in his attempt.]

Luke:
I can't. It's too big.

Yoda:
Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you? Hmm? Hmm. And well you should not. For my ally is the Force, and a powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. Its energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter. You must feel the Force around you; here, between you, me, the tree, the rock, everywhere, yes. Even between the land and the ship.

Luke:
You want the impossible. [sees Yoda use the Force to levitate the X-Wing out of the bog and gets flustered when he does it] I don't... I don't believe it!

Yoda:
That is why you fail.

Yoda:
Luke! You must complete the training.

Luke Skywalker:
I can't keep the vision out of my head. They're my friends. I've gotta help them.

Yoda:
You must not go!

Luke:
But Han and Leia will die if I don't.

Obi-Wan Kenobi:
You don't know that. [appears in spirit] Even Yoda cannot see their fate.

Luke:
But I can help them! I feel the Force!

Obi-Wan:
But you cannot control it! This is a dangerous time for you, when you will be tempted by the Dark Side of the Force.

Yoda:
Yes, yes! To Obi-Wan you listen. The cave! Remember your failure at the cave!

Luke:
But I've learned so much since then. Master Yoda, I promise to return and finish what I've begun. You have my word.

Obi-Wan:
It is you and your abilities the Emperor wants. That is why your friends are made to suffer.

Luke:
That's why I have to go.

Obi-Wan:
Luke, I don't want to lose you to the Emperor the way I lost Vader.

Luke:
You won't.

Yoda:
Stopped they must be. On this all depends. Only a fully trained Jedi Knight with the Force as his ally will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path as Vader did, you will become an agent of evil.

Obi-Wan:
Patience!

Luke:
And sacrifice Han and Leia?

Yoda:
If you honor what they fight for, yes!

Obi-Wan:
If you choose to face Vader, you will do it alone. I cannot interfere.

Luke:
I understand. R2, fire up the converters.

Obi-Wan:
Luke. Don't give in to hate. That leads to the Dark Side.

Yoda:
Strong is Vader. Mind what you have learned. Save you it can.

Luke:
I will and I'll return. I promise. [flies off with X-Wing]

Yoda:
Told you I did. Reckless is he. Now matters are worse.

Obi-Wan:
That boy is our last hope.

Yoda:
No. There is another.

Darth Vader:
You may take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hutt after I have Skywalker.

Boba Fett:
He's no good to me dead.

Vader:
He will not be permanently damaged.

Lando Calrissian:
Lord Vader, what about Leia and the Wookiee?

Vader:
They must never again leave this city.

Lando:
[angry] That was never a condition of our agreement, nor was giving Han to this bounty hunter!

Vader:
Perhaps you think you are being treated unfairly?

Lando:
[pauses] No.

Vader:
Good. It would be unfortunate if I have to leave a garrison here.

Lando:
[under his breath] This deal is getting worse all the time.

[Han kisses Leia and is taken by stormtroopers to the carbon-freezing chamber.]

Leia Organa:
I love you.

Han Solo:
I know.

[Darth Vader has just cut off Luke's right hand, which has his lightsaber]

Darth Vader:
There is no escape. Don't make me destroy you. Luke, you do not yet realize your importance. You've only begun to discover your power. Join me, and I will complete your training. With our combined strength, we can end this destructive conflict, and bring order to the galaxy.

Luke Skywalker:
[wincing angrily] I'll never join you!

Vader:
If only you knew the power of the Dark Side. Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father.

Luke:
He told me enough! He told me you killed him!

Vader:
No, I am your father.

Luke:
[shocked] No. No! That's not true! That's impossible!

Vader:
Search your feelings; you know it to be true.

Luke:
NOOOOOOO! NOOOOOOOO!!!

Vader:
Luke, you can destroy the Emperor. He has foreseen this. It is your destiny. Join me, and together, we can rule the galaxy as father and son. [Luke looks down the shaft and then back at Vader] Come with me. It is the only way. [Luke lets go of the projection and falls into the shaft]

Lando Calrissian:
Luke, we're ready for take off.

Luke Skywalker:
Good luck, Lando.

Lando:
When we find Jabba the Hutt and that bounty hunter, we'll contact you.

Luke:
I'll meet you at the rendezvous point on Tatooine.

Lando:
[to Leia] Princess, we'll find Han. I promise.

Luke:
Chewie, I'll be looking for your signal. Take care you two and may the Force be with you.


Opening Crawl:
It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire. During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the DEATH STAR, an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet. Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of the stolen plans that can save her people and restore freedom to the galaxy....

Obi-Wan Kenobi:
For over a thousand generations, the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic. Before the dark times, before the Empire.

Obi-Wan Kenobi:
A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights. He betrayed and murdered your father. Now the Jedi are all but extinct. Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force.

Obi-Wan Kenobi:
Well, the Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It is an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us; it binds the galaxy together.

Luke:
Are you alright? What's wrong?

Obi-Wan Kenobi:
I felt a great disturbance in the Force...as if millions of voices cried out in terror, and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened.

Obi-Wan Kenobi:
You can't win, Darth. If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.

[Princess Leia has been captured and brought to Vader]

Princess Leia Organa:
[smirking] Darth Vader. Only you could be so bold. The Imperial Senate will not sit still for this. When they hear you've attacked a diplomatic -

Darth Vader:
Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.

Leia:
I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan.

Vader:
You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! [to Stormtroopers] Take her away!

Daine Jir:
[to Vader after Stormtroopers escort her away] Holding her is dangerous. If word of this gets out, it could generate sympathy for the Rebellion in the Senate.

Vader:
I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.

Jir:
She'll die before she'll tell you anything.

Vader:
Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed.

Nahdonnis Praji:
Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship, and no transmissions were made. An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting. No life forms were on board.

Vader:
She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them; see to it personally, Commander. There will be no one to stop us this time!

[R2-D2 abruptly begins playing Leia's holographic message at Ben Kenobi's house]

Luke Skywalker:
I saw part of the message he was...

Ben Kenobi:
I seem to have found it.

Princess Leia Organa:
[in a hologram message] General Kenobi. Years ago, you served my father in the Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire. I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed. I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit. My father will know how to retrieve it. You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan. This is our most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. [looks to the side quickly, then crouches to end the message]

Kenobi:
[to Luke] You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan.

Skywalker:
Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.

Kenobi:
I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.

Skywalker:
Listen, I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.

Kenobi:
That's your uncle talking.

Skywalker:
Oh, boy, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this?

Kenobi:
[pleading] Learn about the Force, Luke.

Skywalker:
Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.

Kenobi:
[resigned] You must do what you feel is right, of course.

Cassio Tagge:
And until this battle station is fully operational, we are vulnerable. The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped. They're more dangerous than you realize!

Conan Antonio Motti:
Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander, not to this battle station.

Tagge:
The Rebellion will continue to gain a support in the Imperial Senate, until...

Wilhuff Tarkin:
[walking in with Darth Vader] The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us. I have just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently. The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away.

Tagge:
That's impossible! How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?

Tarkin:
The regional governors now have direct control over their territories. Fear will keep the local systems in line. Fear of this battle station.

Tagge:
And what of the Rebellion? If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible - however unlikely - that they might find a weakness and exploit it.

Vader:
The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.

Motti:
Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained. This station is now the ultimate power in the universe! I suggest we use it.

Vader:
Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.

Motti:
Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader. [Vader walks toward Motti, then slowly raises his hand] Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebels' hidden fort- [grasps his throat as if he is being choked]

Vader:
I find your lack of faith disturbing.

Tarkin:
Enough of this. Vader, release him!

Vader:
As you wish. [drops his hand and Motti's head hits the table as he regains his breath]

Tarkin:
This bickering is pointless. Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the Rebel fortress by the time this station is operational. We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke.

[Luke just returned to his farm to find it thrashed and sees the burned corpses of Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru.]

Obi-Wan Kenobi:
There was nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there. You would have been killed, too, and the droids would be in the hands of the Empire.

Luke Skywalker:
I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father.

[They set out for Mos Eisley]

Kenobi:
Mos Eisley Spaceport. You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious.

[Han arrives at Docking Bay 94 and sees a familiar face]

Jabba the Hutt:
[in Huttese] Solo! Come out of there, Solo! Solo!!

Han Solo:
Right here, Jabba. [Jabba and his henchmen turn around to see Han and Chewbacca] I've been waiting for you.

Jabba:
Have you now.

Han:
You didn't think I was gonna run, did you?

Jabba:
Han, my boy, you disappoint me. Why haven't you paid me? And why did you fry poor Greedo?

Han:
Look, Jabba, next time you wanna talk to me, come see me yourself. Don't send one of these twerps.

Jabba:
Han, I can't make exceptions. What if everyone who smuggled for me dropped their cargo at the first sign of an Imperial starship? It's not good for business.

Han:
Look, Jabba, even I get boarded sometimes. [accidentally steps on Jabba's tail] Did you think I had a choice? But I got a nice easy charter now; I'll pay you back, plus a little extra. I just need a little more time.

Jabba:
Han, my boy, you're the best smuggler I ever hired. So, for an extra twenty percent...

Han:
Fifteen, Jabba, and don't push it.

Jabba:
Okay, fifteen percent. But if you fail me again, I'll put a price on your head so big, you won't be able to go near a civilized system.

Han:
Jabba, you're a wonderful human being.

Jabba:
[orders minions] Come on. [Jabba's gang leaves with bounty hunter Boba Fett following behind.]

Princess Leia Organa:
Governor Tarkin. I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash. I recognized your foul stench when I was brought onboard.

Wilhuff Tarkin:
Charming to the last. You don't know how hard I found it, signing the order to terminate your life.

Leia:
[sarcastically] I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.

Tarkin:
Princess Leia, before your execution, I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational. No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now.

Leia:
The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.

Tarkin:
Not after we demonstrate the power of this station. In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that will be destroyed first. Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power on your home planet of Alderaan.

Leia:
[shocked] No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly-

Tarkin:
You would prefer another target? A military target?! Then name the system! [stepping closer to Leia and pinning her against Darth Vader] I grow tired of asking this, so it will be the last time. Where is the Rebel base?

Leia:
[looks at Alderaan for a moment, then, resigned] Dantooine. They're on Dantooine.

Tarkin:
There. You see, Lord Vader? She can be reasonable. [to assistant] Continue with the operation. You may fire when ready.

Leia:
[panicked] What?!

Tarkin:
You are far too trusting. Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration, but don't worry. We will deal with your rebel friends soon enough.

Leia:
No!

[The Death Star destroys Alderaan]

[Luke is training with his lightsaber and a laser remote aboard the Millennium Falcon.]

Ben Kenobi:
Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.

Luke Skywalker:
You mean it controls your actions?

Kenobi:
Partially, but it also obeys your commands.

[Luke gets shot by the remote.]

Han Solo:
[laughs] Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.

Skywalker:
You don't believe in the Force, do you?

Solo:
Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. [Kenobi smiles] Anyway, it's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.

Kenobi:
[gets up and takes a blast helmet] I suggest you try it again, Luke. Only this time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. [puts the helmet on Luke, which covers his eyes]

Skywalker:
But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight?

Kenobi:
Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. [remote shoots Luke] Stretch out with your feelings! [Watches Luke succeed in blocking the lasers] You see? You can do it.

Solo:
I call it luck.

Kenobi:
In my experience, there is no such thing as luck.

Darth Vader:
He is here.

Grand Moff Tarkin:
Obi-Wan Kenobi? What makes you think so?

Vader:
A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.

Tarkin:
Surely he must be dead by now.

Vader:
Don't underestimate the Force.

Tarkin:
The Jedi are extinct. Their fire has gone out of the universe. You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion. [An intercom beeps, which Tarkin answers] Yes?

Intercom:
We have an emergency alert in detention block AA23.

Tarkin:
The princess? Put all sections on alert!

Vader:
Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.

Tarkin:
If you are right, he must not be allowed to escape.

Vader:
Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone.

[Luke's X-Wing fighter is in the trench, and Darth Vader is having trouble getting a lock]

Darth Vader:
[Gets a lock] I have you now. [Suddenly, one of Vader's escorts is destroyed.] What?!

Han Solo:
YEAH-HOO!!! [The Millennium Falcon arrives on the scene.]

Vader's Escort:
Look out! [Vader's surviving escort panics and crashes into the trench, and Vader's ship is flung out into space]

Han Solo:
You're all clear, kid. Now let's blow this thing and go home! [Luke shoots at the exhaust port and with the help of the Force, hits, blowing up the Death Star] Great shot, kid! That was one in a million!

Ben Kenobi:
Remember... the Force will be with you, always.

A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...

Opening crawl:
War! The Republic is crumbling under attacks by the ruthless Sith Lord, Count Dooku. There are heroes on both sides. Evil is everywhere. In a stunning move, the fiendish droid leader, General Grievous, has swept into the Republic capital and kidnapped Chancellor Palpatine, leader of the Galactic Senate. As the Separatist Droid Army attempts to flee the besieged capital with their valuable hostage, two Jedi Knights lead a desperate mission to rescue the captive Chancellor....

Chancellor Palpatine:
My mentor taught me everything about the Force, even the nature of the dark side.

Chancellor Palpatine:
Anakin, if one is to understand the great mystery, one must study all its aspects, not just the dogmatic narrow view of the Jedi. If you wish to become a complete and wise leader, you must embrace...a larger view of the Force. Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin. They fear you. In time, they will destroy you. Let me show you the true nature of the Force. Only through me can you achieve a power greater than any Jedi! Learn to know the dark side of the Force, and you will be able to save your wife from certain death.

Chancellor Palpatine:
Anakin. I told you it would come to this. I was right! The Jedi are taking over!!

Obi-Wan Kenobi:
Chancellor.

Anakin Skywalker:
Are you all right?

Palpatine:
[looking behind them] Count Dooku.

Obi-Wan:
This time, we will do it together.

Anakin:
I was about to say that.

Palpatine:
Get help. You're no match for him, he's a Sith Lord.

Obi-Wan:
[turns and smiles] Chancellor Palpatine, Sith Lords are our speciality.

Count Dooku:
Your swords, please. We don't want to make a mess of things in front of the Chancellor.

Obi-Wan:
You won't get away this time, Dooku.

Dooku:
I've been looking forward to this.

Anakin:
My powers have doubled since the last time we met, Count.

Dooku:
Good. Twice the pride, double the fall.

[Chancellor Palpatine and Anakin Skywalker talk about Skywalker's dreams]

Palpatine:
Did you ever hear the Tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise?

Anakin:
No.

Palpatine:
I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith so powerful and so wise, he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create...life. He had such a knowledge of the Dark Side, he could even keep the ones he cared about...from dying.

Anakin:
He could actually...save people from death?

Palpatine:
The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.

Anakin:
What happened to him?

Palpatine:
He became so powerful, the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power...which, eventually of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew. Then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death...but not himself.

Anakin:
Is it possible to learn this power?

Palpatine:
Not from a Jedi.

[Anakin stops Mace Windu from hurting the Chancellor, severing Windu's hand. Palpatine drops his act and again strikes Windu with force-lightning]

Chancellor Palpatine/Darth Sidious:
[Triumphantly] POWER! UNLIMITED... POWER! [sends Windu flying out the window to his death]

Anakin Skywalker:
[Horrified] What have I done...?!

Sidious:
You're fulfilling your destiny, Anakin. Become my apprentice. Learn to use the Dark Side of the Force.

Anakin:
[exhausted] ... I will do whatever you ask.

Sidious:
Good!

Anakin:
Just help me save Padmé's life. I can't live without her.

Sidious:
To cheat death is the power only one has achieved, but if we work together...I know we can discover the secret.

Anakin:
I pledge myself...to your teachings.

Sidious:
Good. Good. ... The Force is strong with you. A powerful Sith, you will become. Henceforth, you shall be known as Darth... Vader.

Darth Vader:
Thank you, my master.

Sidious:
Rise.

Darth Sidious:
Because the Council did not trust you, my young apprentice, I believe you are the only Jedi with no knowledge of this plot. When the Jedi learn what has transpired here, they will kill us, along with all the Senators.

Darth Vader:
I agree. The Council's next move will be against the Senate.

Sidious:
Every single Jedi, including your friend, Obi-Wan Kenobi, is now an enemy of the Republic.

Vader:
I understand, Master.

Sidious:
We must move quickly. The Jedi are relentless. If they are not all destroyed, it will be civil war without end. First, I want you to go to the Jedi Temple. We will catch them off balance. Do what must be done, Lord Vader. Do not hesitate. Show no mercy. Only then will you be strong enough with the Dark Side to save PadmÃ©.

Vader:
What about the other Jedi spread across the galaxy?

Sidious:
Their betrayal will be dealt with. After you have killed all the Jedi in the Temple, go to the Mustafar system. Wipe out Viceroy Gunray and the other Separatist leaders. Once more the Sith will rule the galaxy! And...we shall have...peace.

Palpatine:
... and the Jedi rebellion has been foiled.

Bail Organa:
I was held up. What's happening?

Padmé Amidala:
The Chancellor has been elaborating on a plot by the Jedi to overthrow the Senate.

Palpatine:
The remaining Jedi will be hunted down and defeated. [applause] Any collaborators will suffer the same fate. [applause] These have been trying times, but we have passed the test. The attempt on my life has left me scarred and deformed, but I assure you my resolve has never been stronger. [applause] The war is over. [applause] The Separatists have been defeated, [applause] and the Jedi rebellion has been foiled. We stand on the threshold of a new beginning. In order to ensure our security and continuing stability, the Republic will be reorganized into the first Galactic Empire, for a safe and secure society which I assure you, will last for ten thousand years. [the Senators cheer] An empire that will continue to be ruled by this august body, and a sovereign ruler chosen for life... [the Senators cheer again] An empire ruled by the majority... Ruled by a new constitution...

Padmé:
So this is how liberty dies...with thunderous applause.

[After the massacre at the Jedi temple]

Obi-Wan Kenobi:
I've recalibrated the code, warning all surviving Jedi to stay away.

Yoda:
For the clones, to discover the recalibration, a long time, it will take.

Obi-Wan:
Wait, Master. There is something I must know. [inspects a security hologram]

Yoda:
If into the security recordings, you go, only pain, will you find.

Obi-Wan:
I must know the truth, Master. [watches hologram of Anakin/Vader killing Jedi younglings and pledging allegiance to Palpatine; Horrified] It can't be. It can't be!

Palpatine:
[On hologram] You have done well, my new apprentice. Your skills are unmatched by any Sith before you. Now, Lord Vader, go and bring peace to the Empire.

Obi-Wan:
I can't watch anymore. [deactivates hologram]

Yoda:
Destroy the Sith, we must.

Obi-Wan:
Send me to kill the Emperor. I will not kill Anakin.

Yoda:
To fight this Lord Sidious, strong enough, you are not.

Obi-Wan:
But Anakin...he is like my brother. I cannot do it.

Yoda:
Twisted by the dark side, young Skywalker has become. The boy you trained, gone, he is, consumed by Darth Vader.

Obi-Wan:
I do not know where the Emperor has sent him. I don't know where to look.

Yoda:
Use your feelings, Obi-Wan, and find him, you will.

[Padmé has just arrived on Mustafar, has confronted Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader and they embrace]

Darth Vader:
I saw your ship. What are you doing out here?

Padmé Amidala:
I was so worried about you. Obi-Wan told me terrible things.

Vader:
What things?

Padmé:
He said...that you turned to the Dark Side...that you...killed younglings...

Vader:
Obi-Wan is trying to turn you against me.

Padmé:
He cares about us.

Vader:
Us?

Padmé:
He knows. He wants to help you. Anakin, all I want is your love.

Vader:
Love won't save you, Padmé. Only my new powers can do that.

Padmé:
But at what cost? You're a good person! Don't do this!

Vader:
I won't lose you the way I lost my mother. I am becoming more powerful than any Jedi has ever dreamed of, and I'm doing it for you. To protect you.

Padmé:
Come away with me. Help me raise our child. Leave everything else behind while we still can!

Vader:
Don't you see? We don't have to run away anymore! I have brought peace to the Republic. I am more powerful than the Chancellor; I... I can overthrow him! And together, you and I can rule the galaxy; make things the way we want them to be!

[Padmé slowly backs away from Anakin, shocked]

Padmé:
[shocked] I don't believe what I'm hearing! Obi-Wan was right... you've changed!

Vader:
[angry] I don't want to hear any more about Obi-Wan. The Jedi turned against me. Don't you turn against me!

Padmé:
[crying] I don't know you anymore! Anakin...you're breaking my heart! You're going down a path I cannot follow!

Vader:
[confused] Because of Obi-Wan?

Padmé:
Because of what you've done! What you plan to do! [pleading desperately] Stop! Stop now... come back! I love you!

Vader:
[Enraged and paranoid at seeing Obi-Wan in the main hatchway of her cruiser] LIAR!

Padmé:
[looks back and sees Obi-Wan, then turns back to Anakin; horrified] NO!

Vader:
You're with him! You brought him here to kill me!! [begins to Force-choke Padmé]

Obi-Wan Kenobi:
Let her go, Anakin!

PadmÃ©:
[struggling to breathe] Anakin...

Obi-Wan:
Let... her... go.

[Vader releases Padmé; she collapses into unconsciousness]

[Vader has just choked PadmÃ© into unconsciousness]

Darth Vader:
You turned her against me!

Obi-Wan Kenobi:
You have done that yourself!

Vader:
YOU WILL NOT TAKE HER FROM ME!!

Obi-Wan:
Your anger and your lust for power have already done that. You have allowed this Dark Lord to twist your mind, until now...until now you have become the very thing you swore to destroy.

Vader:
Don't lecture me, Obi-Wan! I see through the lies of the Jedi! I do not fear the Dark Side as you do! I have brought peace, freedom, justice, and security to my new Empire!

Obi-Wan:
[incredulously] Your new Empire?

Vader:
Don't make me kill you.

Obi-Wan:
Anakin, my allegiance is to the Republic! To DEMOCRACY!!

Vader:
If you're not with me, then you're my enemy!

Obi-Wan:
Only a Sith deals in absolutes. I will do what I must.

Vader:
You will try.

[They duel]

[Obi-Wan Kenobi has cut off Vader's legs and part of his remaining good arm on one of Mustafar's higher grounds. Vader is struggling near the lava river]

Obi-Wan Kenobi:
[anguished] You were the Chosen One! It was said that you would destroy the Sith, not join them! Bring balance to the Force, not leave it in darkness! [picks up Anakin Skywalker's lightsaber]

Darth Vader:
I HATE YOU!!!

Obi-Wan:
You were my brother, Anakin! I loved you.

[Vader, now too close to the lava river, catches on fire. Obi-Wan leaves]

[Darth Vader is now a cyborg with prosthetic legs and arms, fully clothed in black armor with respirator mask. The operating table he is on has risen to vertical position]

Palpatine:
Lord Vader, can you hear me?

Darth Vader:
[In mechanical voice] Yes, Master. Where is PadmÃ©? Is she safe? Is she alright?

Palpatine:
It seems, in your anger, you killed her.

Darth Vader:
I... I couldn't have. She was alive! I felt it! [damages several surrounding objects and droids through the Force. He then breaks the clamps that have been holding him down and takes a few steps forward. Palpatine watches, grinning cruelly.] NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!

Yoda:
Hidden, safe, the children must be kept.

Obi-Wan Kenobi:
We must take them somewhere where the Sith will not sense their presence.

Yoda:
Hmm... Split up, they should be.

Senator Bail Organa:
My wife and I will take the girl. We've always talked about adopting a baby girl. She will be loved with us.

Obi-Wan:
And what of the boy?

Yoda:
To Tatooine. To his family, send him.

Obi-Wan:
I will take the child and watch over him.

Yoda:
Until the time is right, disappear we will. [Senator Organa and Obi-Wan bow and start to leave] Master Kenobi, wait a moment. In your solitude on Tatooine, training, I have for you.

Obi-Wan:
Training?

Yoda:
An old friend has learned the path to immortality. One who has returned from the netherworld of the Force... Your old master.

Obi-Wan:
[surprised] Qui-Gon?!

Yoda:
How to commune with him, I will teach you.

The Saga Is Now Complete.

Every Story Has A Hero, Every Hero Has A Destiny, Every Saga Has An End.

General Kenobi. You are a bold one.

Obi-Wan Kenobi:
[jumps down from the upper levels] Hello there.

[All droids activate their weapons and surround Obi-Wan.]

General Grievous:
General Kenobi. You are a bold one. [to the Magna Guards] Kill him!

[The Magna guards advance. Obi-wan pulls down a heating vent on top of them.]

General Grievous:
[to the droids] Back away! I will deal with this Jedi slime myself.

Obi-Wan Kenobi:
Your move.

General Grievous:
You fool. I've been trained in your Jedi arts by Count Dooku.

[Grievous' two arms split into four. Each activates and wields a stolen lightsaber.]

General Grievous:
Attack, Kenobi!

General Grievous:
Ah, yes... the negotiator, General Kenobi. We've been waiting for you.

Battle Droid:
Excuse me. [Takes Anakin's and Obi Wan's lightsabers from them]

General Grievous:
[Angrily snatches the lightsabers from the droid] That wasn't much of a rescue.

Battle Droid:
[sarcastically] You're welcome.

General Grievous:
And [coughs] Anakin Skywalker. I was expecting someone of your reputation to be a little... older.

Anakin Skywalker:
General Grievous. You're shorter than I expected.

General Grievous:
[coughs] Jedi scum.

Obi-Wan Kenobi:
We have a job to do, Anakin. Try not to upset him.

General Grievous:
Your lightsabers will make a fine addition to my collection.

Obi-Wan Kenobi:
Not this time. And this time, you won't escape.

Opening crawl:
There is unrest in the Galactic Senate. Several thousand solar systems have declared their intentions to leave the Republic. This Separatist movement, under the leadership of the mysterious Count Dooku, has made it difficult for the limited number of Jedi Knights to maintain peace and order in the galaxy. Senator Amidala, the former Queen of Naboo, is returning to the Senate to vote on the critical issue of creating an ARMY OF THE REPUBLIC to assist the overwhelmed Jedi....

Queen Jamilla:
We must keep our faith in the Republic. The day we stop believing democracy can work is the day we lose it.

Count Dooku:
Our friends from the Trade Federation have pledged their support. And when their battle droids are combined with yours, we shall have an army greater than any in the galaxy. The Jedi will be overwhelmed. The Republic will agree to any demands we make.

Chancellor Palpatine:
I don't know how much longer I can hold off the vote, my friends. More and more star systems are joining the Separatists.

Mace Windu:
If they do break away-

Palpatine:
I will not let this Republic that has stood for a thousand years be split in two! My negotiations will not fail.

Windu:
If they do, you must realize that there aren't enough Jedi to protect the Republic. We're keepers of the peace, not soldiers.

Palpatine:
Master Yoda, do you really think it will come to war?

Yoda:
Hmmm. The Dark Side clouds everything. Impossible to see, the future is.

[Obi-Wan and Anakin look around a bar in Coruscant for assassin Zam Wesell]

Obi-Wan Kenobi:
Why do I get the feeling you're going to be the death of me?

Anakin Skywalker:
Don't say that, master. You're the closest thing I have to a father.

Kenobi:
Then why don't you listen to me?

Skywalker:
I am trying.

Kenobi:
Do you see him?

Skywalker:
I think he is a she. And I think she's a changeling.

Kenobi:
In that case, be extra careful. Go and find her.

Skywalker:
Where are you going, Master?

Kenobi:
For a drink. [sits down at a counter]

Barfly:
You wanna buy some death sticks?

Kenobi:
[executes Jedi mind trick] You don't want to sell me death sticks.

Barfly:
I don't wanna sell you death sticks.

Obi-Wan Kenobi:
You want to go home and rethink your life.

Barfly:
I wanna go home and rethink my life. [leaves]

Chancellor Palpatine:
And so, they've finally given you an assignment. Your patience has paid off.

Anakin Skywalker:
Your guidance more than my patience.

Palpatine:
You don't need guidance, Anakin. In time, you will learn to trust your feelings. Then, you will be invincible. I have said it many times, you are the most gifted Jedi I have ever met.

Skywalker:
Thank you, Your Excellency.

Palpatine:
I see you becoming the greatest of all the Jedi, Anakin. Even more powerful than Master Yoda.

Anakin Skywalker:
From the moment I met you, all those years ago, not a day has gone by when I haven't thought of you. And now that I'm with you again... I'm in agony. The closer I get to you, the worse it gets. The thought of not being with you... I can't breathe. I'm haunted by the kiss that you should never have given me. My heart is beating... hoping that kiss will not become a scar. You are in my very soul, tormenting me... what can I do? I will do anything you ask. If you are suffering as much as I am, please tell me.

PadmÃ© Amidala:
I can't... We can't... It's not possible.

Skywalker:
Anything is possible, PadmÃ©. Listen to me...

Amidala:
No, you listen! We live in a real world; come back to it. You're studying to become a Jedi, I'm... I'm a senator. If you follow your thoughts through to conclusion, they will take us to a place we cannot go, regardless of the way we feel about each other.

Skywalker:
Then you do feel something!

Amidala:
I will not let you give up your future for me.

Skywalker:
You're asking me to be rational. That is something that I know I cannot do. Believe me, I wish that I could just wish away my feelings, but I can't.

Amidala:
I will not give into this.

Skywalker:
Well, you know, it... it wouldn't have to be that way. We could keep it a secret.

Amidala:
We'd be living a lie, one that we couldn't keep, even if we wanted to. I couldn't do that. Could you, Anakin? Could you live like that?

Skywalker:
No. You're right. It would destroy us all.

Obi-Wan Kenobi:
[on hologram, from Kamino] I have successfully made contact with the Prime Minister of Kamino. They are using a bounty hunter named Jango Fett to create a clone army. I have a strong feeling that this bounty hunter is the assassin we're looking for.

Mace Windu:
Do you think these cloners are involved in the plot to assassinate Senator Amidala?

Kenobi:
No, Master, there appears to be no motive!

Yoda:
Do not assume anything, Obi-Wan. Clear, your mind must be, if you are to discover the real villains behind this plot.

Kenobi:
Yes, Master. They say that a Master Sifo-Dyas placed the order for a clone army at the request of the Senate, almost ten years ago. I was under the impression he was killed before that. Did the Council ever authorize the creation of a clone army?

Windu:
No. Whoever placed that order did not have the authorization of the Jedi Council.

Yoda:
Into custody, take this Jango Fett. Bring him here. Question him, we will.

Kenobi:
Yes, Master. I will report back if and when I have him. [hologram fades]

Yoda:
Blind we are, if the creation of this clone army we could not see.

Windu:
I think it is time we informed the Senate that our ability to use the Force has diminished.

Yoda:
Only the Dark Lords of the Sith know of our weakness. If informed, the Senate is, multiply, our adversaries will.

Obi-Wan Kenobi:
[in holograph recording, Anakin and Padme listen on Tatooine] Anakin, my long-range transmitter has been knocked out. Retransmit this message to Coruscant. [Anakin sends the signal; Palpatine and the Jedi Council watch the recording] I have tracked the bounty hunter Jango Fett to the droid foundries on Geonosis. The Trade Federation is to take delivery of a droid army here, and it is clear that Viceroy Gunray is behind the assassination attempts on Senator Amidala. The Commerce Guild and the Corporate Alliance have both pledged their armies to Count Dooku, and are forming a... Wait, wait. [ignites his lightsaber, blocks a few laser blasts, and a droideka appears as Obi-Wan is captured by Dooku's forces]

Yoda:
More happening on Geonosis, I fear, than has been revealed.

Mace Windu:
I agree. [to Anakin] Anakin, we will deal with Count Dooku; the most important thing for you is to stay where you are. Protect the Senator at all costs. That is your first priority.

Anakin Skywalker:
Understood, Master.

Bail Organa:
The Commerce Guild and the Corporate Alliance are preparing for war. There can be no doubt of that.

Chancellor Palpatine:
Count Dooku must've made a treaty with them.

Organa:
We must stop them before they're ready.

Palpatine:
Master Yoda, how many Jedi are available to go to Geonosis?

Yoda:
Throughout the galaxy, thousands of Jedi, there are. To send on a special mission, only 200 are available.

Organa:
With all due respect for the Jedi Order, Master Yoda, that's not enough.

Yoda:
Through negotiation, the Jedi maintain peace. Starting a war, we have no intention of.

Ask Aak:
[in Huttese] The debate is over. Now we need that clone army.

Organa:
Unfortunately, the debate is not over. The Senate will never approve the use of clones before the Separatists attack.

Mas Amedda:
This is a crisis. The Senate must vote the Chancellor emergency powers. He can then approve the creation of an army.

Palpatine:
But what Senator would have the courage to propose such a radical amendment?

Amedda:
If only...Senator Amidala were here.

[Count Dooku tries to recruit Obi-Wan into the Separatist cause]

Count Dooku:
It's a great pity that our paths have never crossed before, Obi-Wan. Qui-Gon always spoke very highly of you. I wish he were still alive. I could use his help right now.

Obi-Wan Kenobi:
Qui-Gon Jinn would never join you.

Dooku:
Don't be so sure, my young Jedi. You forget that he was once my apprentice, just as you were once his. He knew all about the corruptions of the Senate, but he would never have gone along with it if he had learned the truth as I have.

Kenobi:
The truth?

Dooku:
The truth. What if I told you that the Republic is now under the control of the Dark Lords of the Sith?

Kenobi:
No, that's not possible! The Jedi would be aware it!

Dooku:
The Dark Side of the Force has clouded their vision, my friend. Hundreds of senators are now under the influence of a Sith Lord called Darth Sidious.

Kenobi:
I don't believe you.

Dooku:
The Viceroy of the Trade Federation was once in league with this Darth Sidious, but he was betrayed ten years ago by the Dark Lord. He came to me for help; he told me everything. The Jedi Council wouldn't believe him. I've tried many times to warn them, but they wouldn't listen. By the time they sense the Dark Lord's presence, it would already be too late. You must join me, Obi-Wan, and together we will destroy the Sith!

Kenobi:
I will never join you, Dooku.

Dooku:
[coldly] It may be difficult to secure your release.

[While chasing Count Dooku across the desert of Geonosis, Anakin insists on rescuing PadmÃ©, who, after a hit to the ship they're on, falls out and onto the sand below]

Anakin Skywalker:
PadmÃ©! [To pilot] Put the ship down!

Obi-Wan Kenobi:
Anakin! Don't let your personal feelings get in the way! [to pilot] Follow that speeder.

Skywalker:
[To pilot] Lower the ship!

Kenobi:
I can't take Dooku alone! I need you! If we catch him, we can end this war right now! We have a job to do!

Skywalker:
I don't care! [To pilot] Put the ship down!

Kenobi:
YOU WILL BE EXPELLED FROM THE JEDI ORDER!

Skywalker:
I CAN'T LEAVE HER!

Kenobi:
COME TO YOUR SENSES! What do you think PadmÃ© would do were she in your position?

Skywalker:
[resigned] She would do her duty.

Count Dooku:
The Force is with us, Master Sidious.

Darth Sidious:
Welcome home, Lord Tyranus. You have done well.

Dooku:
I have good news for you, my lord. The war has begun.

Sidious:
Excellent. Everything is going as planned...

Obi-Wan Kenobi:
Do you believe what Count Dooku said about Sidious controlling the Senate? It doesn't feel right.

Yoda:
Joined the Dark Side, Dooku has. Lies, deceit, creating mistrust are his ways now.

Mace Windu:
Nevertheless, I think we should keep a closer eye on the Senate.

Yoda:
I agree.

Windu:
Where is your apprentice?

Kenobi:
On his way to Naboo, escorting Senator Amidala home. I must admit that without the clones, it would not have been victory.

Yoda:
Victory? Victory, you say? Master Obi-Wan, not victory. The shroud of the Dark Side has fallen. Begun, the Clone War has!

A Jedi Shall Not Know Anger. Nor Hatred. Nor Love.

The Clones Are Coming...

Rastreio de abertura:

Há inquietação no Senado Galáctico. Vários milhares de sistemas solares declararam sua intenção de deixar a República. Este movimento separatista, sob a liderança do misterioso conde Dookan, tornou difícil para o número limitado de cavaleiros Jedi manter a paz e a ordem na galáxia. O senador Amidala, a ex-rainha de Naboo, está retornando ao Senado para votar a questão crítica da criação de um EXÉRCITO DA REPÚBLICA para ajudar os oprimidos Jedi.

just a simple man trying to make his way in the galaxy

-Jango Fett

Opening crawl:
Turmoil has engulfed the Galactic Republic. The taxation of trade routes to outlying star systems is in dispute. Hoping to resolve the matter with a blockade of deadly battleships, the greedy Trade Federation has stopped all shipping to the small planet of Naboo. While the congress of the Republic endlessly debates this alarming chain of events, the Supreme Chancellor has secretly dispatched two Jedi Knights, the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy, to settle the conflict....

Yoda:
Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering. I sense much fear in you.

Obi-Wan Kenobi:
I have a bad feeling about this.

Qui-Gon Jinn:
I don't sense anything.

Kenobi:
It's not about the mission, Master. It's something... elsewhere. Elusive.

Qui-Gon:
Don't center on your anxieties, Obi-Wan. Keep your concentration here and now, where it belongs.

Kenobi:
But Master Yoda says I should be mindful of the future.

Qui-Gon:
But not at the expense of the moment. Be mindful of the living Force, young Padawan.

Kenobi:
Yes, Master. How do you think this Trade Viceroy will deal with the Chancellor's demands?

Qui-Gon:
These Federation types are cowards. The negotiations will be short.

Darth Sidious:
What is it?

Daultay Dofine:
[interrupts] This scheme of yours has failed, Lord Sidious. The blockade is finished. We dare not go against the Jedi.

Sidious:
Viceroy, I don't want this stunted slime in my sight again. [Daultay leaves] This turn of events is unfortunate. We must accelerate our plans. Begin landing your troops.

Nute Gunray:
My lord! Is that... legal?

Sidious:
I will make it legal.

Gunray:
And the Jedi?

Sidious:
The Chancellor should never have brought them into this! Kill them immediately!

Gunray:
Yes...yes, my lord. As you wish.

Qui-Gon Jinn:
Do you hear that?

[a rumbling is heard in the distance]

Jar Jar Binks:
Yeah.

Qui-Gon:
That is the sound of a thousand terrible things headed this way.

Obi-Wan Kenobi:
If and when they find us, they will crush us, grind us into tiny pieces and blast us into oblivion!

Binks:
Hmmm... yousa point is well seen. This way. Hurry!

Ric Olie:
There's not enough power to get us to Coruscant...the hyperdrive is leaking.

Qui-Gon Jinn:
We'll have to land somewhere to refuel and repair the ship.

Obi-Wan Kenobi:
[studying a map] Here, Master. Tatooine. It's small, out of the way, poor... The Trade Federation has no presence there.

Panaka:
How can you be sure?

Qui-Gon:
It's controlled by the Hutts.

Panaka:
[alarmed] You can't take Her Royal Highness there! The Hutts are gangsters! If they discovered her...

Qui-Gon:
... It would be no different than if we landed on a system controlled by the Federation. Except the Hutts aren't looking for her, which gives us an advantage.

Darth Sidious:
And Queen Amidala...has she signed the treaty?

Nute Gunray:
She has disappeared, my lord. One Naboo cruiser got past the blockade.

Sidious:
[annoyed] I want that treaty signed!

Gunray:
My lord...it's impossible to locate the ship! It's out of our range!

Sidious:
Not for a Sith. [hologram of Darth Maul appears in front of Viceroy Gunray] This is my apprentice, Darth Maul. He will find your lost ship. [holograms of Sidious and Maul fade]

Gunray:
This is getting out of hand. Now there are two of them!!

Rune Haako:
We should not have made this bargain.

Watto:
...Here it is...a T-14 hyperdrive generator!! Thee in luck, I'm the only one hereabouts who has one...but thee might as well buy a new ship. It would be cheaper, I think...Saying of which, how's thee going to pay for all this?

Qui-Gon Jinn:
I have 20,000 republic dataries...

Watto:
Republic credits? Republic credits are no use out here. I need something different, something more real...

Qui-Gon:
I don't have anything else, but credits will do fine. [waves his hand, attempting to use the Jedi mind trick]

Watto:
No, they won'ta.

Qui-Gon:
Credits will do fine. [tries the mind trick again]

Watto:
No, they won'ta! What, you think you're some kind of Jedi, waving your hand around like that? I'm a Toydarian. Mind tricks won't work on me; only money. No money! No parts! No deal! And no one else has a T-14 hyperdrive, I promise you that.

Darth Maul:
Tatooine is sparsely populated. If the trace was correct, I will find them quickly, Master.

Darth Sidious:
Move against the Jedi first. You will then have no difficulty taking the Queen back to Naboo to sign the treaty.

Maul:
At last we will reveal ourselves to the Jedi. At last we will have revenge.

Sidious:
You have been well trained, my young apprentice. They will be no match for you.

Finis Valorum:
The chair recognizes the Senator from the sovereign system of Naboo.

Palpatine:
Supreme Chancellor, delegates of the Senate, a tragedy has occurred... which started right here with the taxation of trade routes... and has now engulfed our entire planet... in the oppression of the Trade Federation.

Lott Dod:
This is outrageous! I object to the senator's statements!

Valorum:
The chair does not recognize the senator from the Trade Federation at this time.

Palpatine:
To state our allegations, I present Queen Amidala, recently elected ruler of the Naboo, who speaks on our behalf.

PadmÃ© Amidala:
Honorable representatives of the Republic, I come to you under the gravest of circumstances. The Naboo system has been invaded by the droid armies of the Trade...

Dod:
I object! There is no proof! This is incredible. We recommend a commission be sent to Naboo to ascertain the truth.

Senator Teem:
The Congress of Malastare concurs with the honorable delegate from the Trade Federation. A commission must be appointed.

Valorum:
The point...

Mas Amedda:
Excuse me, Chancellor. [whispers to Chancellor Valorum]

Palpatine:
[Whispering to Queen Amidala] Enter the bureaucrats, the true rulers of the Republic. And on the payroll of the Trade Federation, I might add. This is where Chancellor Valorum's strength will disappear.

Valorum:
The point is conceded. Will you defer your motion to allow a commission to explore the validity of your accusations?

PadmÃ©:
I will not defer. I've come before you to resolve this attack on our sovereignty now! I was not elected to watch my people suffer and die while you discuss this invasion in a committee! If this body is not capable of action, I suggest new leadership is needed. I move for a vote of no confidence in Chancellor Valorum's leadership.

[The Senators begin arguing over Queen Amidala's decision, as Valorum sits down, stunned]

Mas Amedda:
ORDER!!

Palpatine:
Now they will elect a new Chancellor, a strong Chancellor. One who will not let this tragedy continue.

Qui-Gon Jinn:
[dying] It's too late, it's...

Obi-Wan Kenobi:
No!

Qui-Gon:
Obi-Wan, promise... Promise me you will train the boy.

Obi-Wan:
Yes, master.

Qui-Gon:
He... is the Chosen One. He... will bring balance. Train him.

Yoda:
Confer on you the level of Jedi Knight, the Council does. But agree with your taking this boy as your Padawan learner, I do not!

Obi-Wan Kenobi:
Qui-Gon believed in him.

Yoda:
The Chosen One, the boy may be. Nevertheless, grave danger, I fear in his training.

Kenobi:
Master Yoda, I gave Qui-Gon my word. I will train Anakin... without the approval of the Council, if I must.

Yoda:
Qui-Gon's defiance, I sense in you. Need that, you do not. Agree with you, the Council does. Your apprentice, Skywalker will be.

[After Darth Maul's defeat]

Mace Windu:
There's no doubt. The mysterious warrior was a Sith.

Yoda:
Always two, there are. No more, no less. A master... and an apprentice.

Windu:
But which one was destroyed? The master or the apprentice?

Tagline:
Every generation has a legend. Every journey has a first step. Every saga has a beginning.

Tagline:
One Truth, One Hate.

1
00:02:28,665 -- 00:02:32,164
Command station, this is ST-321.
Code clearance blue.

2
00:02:32,294 -- 00:02:35,211
We're starting our approach.
Deactivate the security shield.

3
00:02:36,006 -- 00:02:38,045
The security deflector shield
will be deactivated...

4
00:02:38,174 -- 00:02:40,463
when we have confirmation
of your code transmission.

5
00:02:40,594 -- 00:02:41,756
Stand by.

6
00:02:43,263 -- 00:02:45,137
You are clear to proceed.

7
00:02:45,265 -- 00:02:47,554
We're starting our approach.

8
00:03:14,502 -- 00:03:17,669
Inform the commander
that Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived.

9
00:03:17,797 -- 00:03:18,877
Sir.

10
00:03:55,752 -- 00:03:58,753
Lord Vader, this is an unexpected
pleasure. We're honoured.

11
00:03:58,880 -- 00:04:01,169
You may dispense
with the pleasantries, Commander.

12
00:04:01,299 -- 00:04:03,790
I'm here to put you back on schedule.

13
00:04:03,927 -- 00:04:06,963
I assure you, Lord Vader,
my men are working as fast as they can.

14
00:04:07,097 -- 00:04:10,513
Perhaps I can find
new ways to motivate them.

15
00:04:11,851 -- 00:04:14,805
I tell you this station
will be operational as planned.

16
00:04:15,605 -- 00:04:20,896
The emperor does not share your
optimistic appraisal of the situation.

17
00:04:21,150 -- 00:04:24,353
But he asks the impossible.
I need more men.

18
00:04:24,487 -- 00:04:27,607
Then perhaps you can tell him
when he arrives.

19
00:04:28,866 -- 00:04:32,366
- The emperor's coming here?
- That is correct, Commander...

20
00:04:32,495 -- 00:04:37,240
and he is most displeased with
your apparent lack of progress.

21
00:04:38,042 -- 00:04:39,834
We shall double our efforts.

22
00:04:39,961 -- 00:04:43,246
I hope so, Commander, for your sake.

23
00:04:43,381 -- 00:04:47,248
The emperor is not
as forgiving as I am.

24
00:05:05,194 -- 00:05:07,650
Of course I'm worried.
And you should be too.

25
00:05:07,780 -- 00:05:11,564
Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca
never returned from this awful place.

26
00:05:13,995 -- 00:05:15,987
Don't be so sure.

27
00:05:16,122 -- 00:05:19,408
If I told you half the things
I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt...

28
00:05:19,542 -- 00:05:21,416
you'd probably short-circuit.

29
00:05:33,931 -- 00:05:35,971
R2, are you sure
this is the right place?

30
00:05:41,105 -- 00:05:43,228
I'd better knock, I suppose.

31
00:05:45,068 -- 00:05:48,982
There doesn't seem to be anyone here.
Let's go back and tell Master Luke.

32
00:05:52,575 -- 00:05:54,484
Goodness gracious me!

33
00:06:17,809 -- 00:06:20,134
I don't think
they're going to let us in, R2.

34
00:06:21,979 -- 00:06:23,889
We'd better go.

35
00:06:32,949 -- 00:06:34,573
R2, wait.

36
00:06:36,494 -- 00:06:38,451
Oh, dear. R2.

37
00:06:38,579 -- 00:06:41,865
R2, I really don't think
we should rush into all this.

38
00:06:42,917 -- 00:06:44,957
Oh, R2!

39
00:06:45,086 -- 00:06:46,664
R2, wait for me!

40
00:06:53,845 -- 00:06:57,379
Just you deliver Master Luke's message
and get us out of here.

41
00:06:57,515 -- 00:06:59,472
Oh, my!

42
00:07:03,438 -- 00:07:04,552
Oh, no.

43
00:07:09,652 -- 00:07:11,111
Oh, my.

44
00:07:16,117 -- 00:07:18,952
We bring a message
to your master, Jabba the Hutt.

45
00:07:22,665 -- 00:07:24,872
And a gift.

46
00:07:25,001 -- 00:07:26,329
What gift?

47
00:07:42,852 -- 00:07:48,059
He says that our instructions
are to give it only to Jabba himself.

48
00:07:57,950 -- 00:08:01,651
I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever
so stubborn about these sort of things.

49
00:08:04,082 -- 00:08:07,497
R2, I have a bad feeling about this.

50
00:08:42,328 -- 00:08:44,155
Good morning.

51
00:08:49,460 -- 00:08:51,667
The message, R2.
The message.

52
00:09:01,681 -- 00:09:03,389
iGreetings, Exalted One./i

53
00:09:03,516 -- 00:09:05,805
iAllow me to introduce myself./i

54
00:09:05,935 -- 00:09:09,802
iI am Luke Skywalker,/i
iJedi knight and friend to Captain Solo./i

55
00:09:10,606 -- 00:09:13,276
iI know that you are powerful,/i
imighty Jabba.../i

56
00:09:13,401 -- 00:09:17,066
iand that your anger with Solo/i
imust be equally powerful./i

57
00:09:17,196 -- 00:09:20,980
iI seek an audience with Your Greatness/i
ito bargain for Solo's life./i

58
00:09:24,787 -- 00:09:27,409
iWith your wisdom, I'm sure/i
iwe can work out an arrangement.../i

59
00:09:27,540 -- 00:09:29,248
iwhich will be mutually beneficial.../i

60
00:09:29,375 -- 00:09:32,045
iand enable us to avoid/i
iany unpleasant confrontation./i

61
00:09:34,088 -- 00:09:37,338
iAs a token of my goodwill,/i
iI present to you a gift.../i

62
00:09:37,467 -- 00:09:39,210
ithese two droids./i

63
00:09:39,343 -- 00:09:41,217
What did he say?

64
00:09:41,345 -- 00:09:44,880
iBoth are hard-working/i
iand will serve you well./i

65
00:09:45,016 -- 00:09:48,764
This can't be.
R2, you're playing the wrong message.

66
00:09:55,360 -- 00:09:57,151
He's no Jedi.

67
00:09:59,781 -- 00:10:03,613
There will be no bargain.

68
00:10:03,743 -- 00:10:05,949
We're doomed.

69
00:10:06,079 -- 00:10:13,042
I will not give up
my favourite decoration.

70
00:10:14,545 -- 00:10:17,961
I like Captain Solo where he is.

71
00:10:19,675 -- 00:10:21,752
R2, look. Captain Solo.

72
00:10:21,886 -- 00:10:24,424
And he's still frozen in carbonite.

73
00:10:37,568 -- 00:10:40,024
What could possibly
have come over Master Luke?

74
00:10:41,072 -- 00:10:45,022
Was it something I did? He never
expressed any unhappiness with my work.

75
00:10:46,077 -- 00:10:47,701
How horrid!

76
00:11:16,399 -- 00:11:18,937
Good. New acquisitions.

77
00:11:19,068 -- 00:11:21,690
You are a protocol droid,
are you not?

78
00:11:21,821 -- 00:11:23,730
I am C-3PO...

79
00:11:23,865 -- 00:11:25,608
Yes or no will do.

80
00:11:25,742 -- 00:11:27,236
Well, yes.

81
00:11:27,368 -- 00:11:29,859
How many languages do you speak?

82
00:11:29,996 -- 00:11:33,614
I am fluent in over six million forms
of communication and can readily...

83
00:11:33,750 -- 00:11:36,371
Splendid. We have been
without an interpreter...

84
00:11:36,502 -- 00:11:39,836
since our master got angry
with our last protocol droid...

85
00:11:39,964 -- 00:11:41,755
and disintegrated him.

86
00:11:41,883 -- 00:11:43,460
Disintegrated?

87
00:11:48,431 -- 00:11:52,179
Guard, this protocol droid
might be useful.

88
00:11:52,310 -- 00:11:54,468
Fit him with a restraining bolt...

89
00:11:54,604 -- 00:11:57,937
and take him back up to
His Excellency's main audience chamber.

90
00:11:58,066 -- 00:12:00,521
R2, don't leave me!

91
00:12:05,740 -- 00:12:07,816
You're a feisty little one...

92
00:12:07,950 -- 00:12:10,406
but you'll soon learn some respect.

93
00:12:10,536 -- 00:12:13,822
I have need for you on
the master's sail barge...

94
00:12:13,956 -- 00:12:16,661
and I think you'll fill in nicely.

95
00:12:45,279 -- 00:12:48,648
Ah! Do that again!

96
00:14:42,021 -- 00:14:46,233
I have come for the bounty
on this Wookiee.

97
00:14:47,276 -- 00:14:48,605
Oh, no. Chewbacca.

98
00:14:52,281 -- 00:14:56,908
At last we have the mighty Chewbacca.

99
00:15:02,709 -- 00:15:05,496
Yes, I am here,
Your Worshipfulness.

100
00:15:06,671 -- 00:15:07,951
Yes?

101
00:15:17,223 -- 00:15:19,180
The illustrious Jabba
bids you welcome...

102
00:15:19,308 -- 00:15:21,882
and will gladly pay you
the reward of 25,000.

103
00:15:22,937 -- 00:15:24,977
I want 50,000. No less.

104
00:15:25,773 -- 00:15:27,766
50,000. No less.

105
00:15:40,830 -- 00:15:42,408
What did I say?

106
00:15:48,796 -- 00:15:51,418
The mighty Jabba asks why
he must pay 50,000.

107
00:15:55,470 -- 00:15:57,711
Because he's holding
a thermal detonator.

108
00:16:09,067 -- 00:16:13,563
This bounty hunter
is my kind of scum...

109
00:16:14,530 -- 00:16:17,318
fearless and inventive.

110
00:16:26,751 -- 00:16:29,586
Jabba offers the sum of 35...

111
00:16:29,712 -- 00:16:31,871
and I do suggest you take it.

112
00:16:37,428 -- 00:16:39,053
He agrees!

113
00:19:29,225 -- 00:19:31,633
Just relax for a moment.

114
00:19:31,769 -- 00:19:34,391
You're free of the carbonite.

115
00:19:36,482 -- 00:19:39,934
You have hibernation sickness.

116
00:19:40,069 -- 00:19:44,530
- I can't see.
- Your eyesight will return in time.

117
00:19:44,657 -- 00:19:47,943
- Where am I?
- Jabba's palace.

118
00:19:51,247 -- 00:19:52,872
Who are you?

119
00:19:57,879 -- 00:20:00,334
- Someone who loves you.
- Leia.

120
00:20:03,926 -- 00:20:05,836
I gotta get you out of here.

121
00:20:08,556 -- 00:20:10,299
What's that?

122
00:20:13,061 -- 00:20:14,934
I know that laugh.

123
00:20:20,902 -- 00:20:22,182
Hey, Jabba.

124
00:20:22,320 -- 00:20:25,155
Look, Jabba, I was just
on my way to pay you back.

125
00:20:25,281 -- 00:20:28,152
I got a little sidetracked.
It's not my fault.

126
00:20:28,284 -- 00:20:31,985
It's too late for that, Solo.

127
00:20:32,121 -- 00:20:36,830
You may have been a good smuggler...

128
00:20:36,959 -- 00:20:40,411
but now you're Bantha fodder.

129
00:20:45,093 -- 00:20:46,093
Look...

130
00:20:47,345 -- 00:20:49,384
Take him away.

131
00:20:49,514 -- 00:20:51,257
Jabba, I'll pay you triple.

132
00:20:51,391 -- 00:20:53,882
You're throwing away a fortune here.
Don't be a fool.

133
00:20:56,813 -- 00:20:58,971
Bring her to me.

134
00:21:03,027 -- 00:21:05,067
We have powerful friends.

135
00:21:05,196 -- 00:21:07,438
You're gonna regret this.

136
00:21:09,325 -- 00:21:11,199
I'm sure.

137
00:21:15,248 -- 00:21:17,075
I can't bear to watch.

138
00:21:31,681 -- 00:21:33,140
Chewie?

139
00:21:34,934 -- 00:21:36,891
Chewie, is that you?

140
00:21:38,855 -- 00:21:41,428
Wait a minute.
I can't see, pal.

141
00:21:42,525 -- 00:21:44,434
What's going on?

142
00:21:46,988 -- 00:21:48,565
Luke? Luke's crazy.

143
00:21:48,698 -- 00:21:52,233
He can't even take care of himself,
much less rescue anybody.

144
00:21:54,120 -- 00:21:55,994
A Jedi knight?

145
00:21:56,873 -- 00:22:00,657
I'm out of it for a little while,
everybody gets delusions of grandeur.

146
00:22:04,130 -- 00:22:06,004
I'm all right, pal.

147
00:22:07,800 -- 00:22:09,425
I'm all right.

148
00:23:03,314 -- 00:23:05,390
I must speak with Jabba.

149
00:23:10,655 -- 00:23:12,564
No bargain.

150
00:23:12,699 -- 00:23:15,154
You will take me to Jabba now.

151
00:23:19,622 -- 00:23:21,413
You serve your master well.

152
00:23:23,376 -- 00:23:25,285
And you will be rewarded.

153
00:23:34,178 -- 00:23:37,428
At last! Master Luke's
come to rescue me.

154
00:23:37,557 -- 00:23:38,967
Master.

155
00:23:41,060 -- 00:23:44,145
Luke Skywalker, Jedi knight.

156
00:23:44,272 -- 00:23:48,519
I told you not to admit him.

157
00:23:48,651 -- 00:23:50,443
I must be allowed to speak.

158
00:23:50,570 -- 00:23:53,321
He must be allowed to speak.

159
00:23:54,157 -- 00:23:57,111
You weak-minded fool!

160
00:23:59,162 -- 00:24:03,491
He's using an old Jedi mind trick.

161
00:24:03,624 -- 00:24:07,076
You will bring Captain Solo
and the Wookiee to me.

162
00:24:13,051 -- 00:24:18,211
Your mind powers
will not work on me, boy.

163
00:24:18,347 -- 00:24:20,506
Nevertheless...

164
00:24:20,641 -- 00:24:23,595
I'm taking Captain Solo
and his friends.

165
00:24:23,728 -- 00:24:27,560
You can either profit by this
or be destroyed.

166
00:24:27,690 -- 00:24:30,644
It's your choice, but I warn you
not to underestimate my powers.

167
00:24:32,904 -- 00:24:34,980
Master Luke, you're standing on...

168
00:24:35,114 -- 00:24:39,693
There will be no bargain, young Jedi.

169
00:24:40,912 -- 00:24:44,447
I shall enjoy watching you die.

170
00:25:15,530 -- 00:25:18,103
Oh, no! The rancor!

171
00:28:05,450 -- 00:28:09,115
Bring me Solo and the Wookiee.

172
00:28:09,245 -- 00:28:13,457
They will all suffer for this outrage.

173
00:28:28,347 -- 00:28:29,347
Han.

174
00:28:32,894 -- 00:28:36,097
- Are you all right?
- Fine. Together again, huh?

175
00:28:36,230 -- 00:28:38,638
- Wouldn't miss it.
- How are we doin'

176
00:28:38,775 -- 00:28:41,444
- Same as always.
- That bad, huh?

177
00:28:41,569 -- 00:28:44,060
- Where's Leia?
- I'm here.

178
00:28:47,700 -- 00:28:49,159
Oh, dear.

179
00:28:50,036 -- 00:28:53,120
His High Exaltedness,
the great Jabba the Hutt...

180
00:28:53,247 -- 00:28:56,284
has decreed that you are
to be terminated immediately.

181
00:28:56,417 -- 00:28:58,042
Good. I hate long waits.

182
00:29:00,463 -- 00:29:03,036
You will therefore be taken
to the Dune Sea...

183
00:29:03,174 -- 00:29:05,499
and cast into the Pit of Carkoon...

184
00:29:05,635 -- 00:29:07,924
nesting place
of the all-powerful Sarlacc.

185
00:29:08,054 -- 00:29:09,252
Doesn't sound so bad.

186
00:29:09,389 -- 00:29:13,256
In his belly, you will find a new
definition of pain and suffering...

187
00:29:13,393 -- 00:29:16,477
as you are slowly digested
over 1,000 years.

188
00:29:17,980 -- 00:29:20,103
On second thought,
let's pass on that.

189
00:29:20,233 -- 00:29:21,857
You should have bargained, Jabba.

190
00:29:25,697 -- 00:29:28,152
That's the last mistake
you'll ever make.

191
00:30:19,709 -- 00:30:21,417
I think my eyes are getting better.

192
00:30:21,544 -- 00:30:24,664
Instead of a big dark blur,
I see a big light blur.

193
00:30:25,548 -- 00:30:28,715
There's nothing to see.
I used to live here, you know.

194
00:30:28,843 -- 00:30:31,678
You're gonna die here,
you know. Convenient.

195
00:30:31,804 -- 00:30:34,093
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando.

196
00:30:34,223 -- 00:30:36,549
I've taken care of everything.

197
00:30:37,435 -- 00:30:38,715
Great.

198
00:30:42,857 -- 00:30:49,191
Soon you will learn to appreciate me.

199
00:30:51,115 -- 00:30:52,396
I'm terribly sorry.

200
00:30:52,533 -- 00:30:55,451
R2, what are you doing here?

201
00:30:55,578 -- 00:30:58,614
I can see you're serving drinks,
but this place is dangerous.

202
00:30:58,748 -- 00:31:01,702
They're going to execute Master Luke,
and if we're not careful, us too.

203
00:31:04,587 -- 00:31:06,496
I wish I had your confidence.

204
00:31:29,821 -- 00:31:32,027
Victims of the almighty Sarlacc...

205
00:31:32,156 -- 00:31:35,276
His Excellency hopes
that you will die honourably.

206
00:31:37,161 -- 00:31:39,735
But should any of you
wish to beg for mercy...

207
00:31:39,872 -- 00:31:43,870
the great Jabba the Hutt
will now listen to your pleas.

208
00:31:48,089 -- 00:31:53,428
3PO, you tell that slimy piece
of worm-ridden filth...

209
00:31:53,553 -- 00:31:56,174
he'll get no such pleasure from us!

210
00:31:56,305 -- 00:31:58,097
Right?

211
00:32:01,394 -- 00:32:03,470
This is your last chance.

212
00:32:04,027 -- 00:32:06,105
Free us or die.

213
00:32:10,153 -- 00:32:12,940
Move him into position.

214
00:32:37,138 -- 00:32:39,380
Put him in.

215
00:33:03,831 -- 00:33:05,290
Easy, Chewie.

216
00:33:15,259 -- 00:33:16,718
Help!

217
00:33:23,476 -- 00:33:25,682
Chewie, you're hit?
Where is it?

218
00:33:31,776 -- 00:33:33,235
Han, Chewie!

219
00:33:33,361 -- 00:33:34,392
Lando.

220
00:33:42,578 -- 00:33:43,823
Boba Fett?

221
00:33:45,873 -- 00:33:47,284
Boba Fett? Where?

222
00:34:20,491 -- 00:34:22,484
- Lando, grab it!
- Lower it!

223
00:34:22,618 -- 00:34:23,994
I'm trying!

224
00:34:46,142 -- 00:34:48,550
Grab me, Chewie.
Grab it!

225
00:35:01,282 -- 00:35:03,524
Grab it. Almost.
You almost got it.

226
00:35:12,919 -- 00:35:14,247
Gently, now.

227
00:35:14,379 -- 00:35:16,418
Easy. Hold me, Chewie.

228
00:35:28,184 -- 00:35:29,726
Chewie, give me the gun.

229
00:35:29,852 -- 00:35:32,853
- Don't move, Lando.
- Wait! I thought you were blind!

230
00:35:32,980 -- 00:35:34,973
I can see a lot better.
Don't move.

231
00:35:35,108 -- 00:35:36,650
A little higher!

232
00:35:39,821 -- 00:35:41,813
Chewie, pull us up.

233
00:35:42,949 -- 00:35:44,491
Up, Chewie. Up.

234
00:35:46,327 -- 00:35:47,905
We gotta get out of here.

235
00:35:48,621 -- 00:35:50,412
Not my eyes! R2, help!

236
00:35:51,541 -- 00:35:52,541
Quickly, R2!

237
00:35:54,001 -- 00:35:55,033
Beast!

238
00:36:00,425 -- 00:36:02,251
Get the gun!

239
00:36:02,385 -- 00:36:03,630
Point it at the deck.

240
00:36:09,183 -- 00:36:10,725
Point it at the deck!

241
00:36:14,522 -- 00:36:17,060
R2, where are we going?
I couldn't possibly...

242
00:36:22,280 -- 00:36:23,739
Come on.

243
00:36:31,789 -- 00:36:34,245
- Let's go. Don't forget the droids.
- We're on our way.

244
00:37:13,790 -- 00:37:15,533
I'll meet you back at the fleet.

245
00:37:15,666 -- 00:37:18,288
iHurry. The Alliance/i
ishould be assembled by now./i

246
00:37:18,419 -- 00:37:21,089
- I will.
- iLuke, thanks./i

247
00:37:21,214 -- 00:37:24,464
iThanks for coming after me./i
iNow I owe you one./i

248
00:37:30,181 -- 00:37:32,589
That's right, R2.
We're going to the Dagobah system.

249
00:37:39,023 -- 00:37:41,265
I have a promise to keep...

250
00:37:41,401 -- 00:37:43,358
to an old friend.

251
00:38:34,537 -- 00:38:35,996
Rise, my friend.

252
00:38:42,712 -- 00:38:45,962
The Death Star will be
completed on schedule.

253
00:38:46,758 -- 00:38:49,249
You've done well, Lord Vader.

254
00:38:49,385 -- 00:38:55,221
Now I sense you wish to continue
your search for young Skywalker.

255
00:38:57,685 -- 00:38:59,096
Yes, my master.

256
00:38:59,896 -- 00:39:02,517
Patience, my friend.

257
00:39:02,648 -- 00:39:05,982
In time, he will seek you out.

258
00:39:06,110 -- 00:39:10,523
When he does,
you must bring him before me.

259
00:39:10,656 -- 00:39:12,945
He has grown strong.

260
00:39:13,076 -- 00:39:18,746
Only together can we turn him
to the dark side of the Force.

261
00:39:18,873 -- 00:39:20,616
As you wish.

262
00:39:22,251 -- 00:39:26,249
Everything is proceeding
as I have foreseen.

263
00:39:52,699 -- 00:39:54,525
That face you make...

264
00:39:55,618 -- 00:39:58,156
Look I so old to young eyes?

265
00:39:58,287 -- 00:40:00,031
No, of course not.

266
00:40:01,457 -- 00:40:03,082
I do.

267
00:40:06,212 -- 00:40:08,169
Yes, I do.

268
00:40:10,341 -- 00:40:12,832
Sick have I become.

269
00:40:12,969 -- 00:40:14,926
Old and weak.

270
00:40:19,600 -- 00:40:21,510
When 900 years old you reach...

271
00:40:21,644 -- 00:40:23,471
look as good you will not.

272
00:40:30,361 -- 00:40:32,484
Soon will I rest.

273
00:40:32,613 -- 00:40:35,733
Yes. Forever sleep.

274
00:40:37,368 -- 00:40:38,993
Earned it I have.

275
00:40:39,120 -- 00:40:41,789
Master Yoda, you can't die.

276
00:40:43,374 -- 00:40:46,044
Strong am I with the Force...

277
00:40:46,169 -- 00:40:48,126
but not that strong.

278
00:40:50,840 -- 00:40:55,965
Twilight is upon me,
and soon night must fall.

279
00:40:59,932 -- 00:41:01,557
That is the way of things...

280
00:41:03,770 -- 00:41:05,893
the way of the Force.

281
00:41:07,815 -- 00:41:09,689
But I need your help.

282
00:41:09,817 -- 00:41:12,984
I've come back
to complete the training.

283
00:41:13,112 -- 00:41:15,235
No more training do you require.

284
00:41:15,365 -- 00:41:18,484
Already know you
that which you need.

285
00:41:22,053 -- 00:41:23,863
Then I am a Jedi.

286
00:41:30,700 -- 00:41:32,360
Not yet.

287
00:41:32,493 -- 00:41:34,486
One thing remains...

288
00:41:35,538 -- 00:41:39,951
Vader. You must confront Vader.

289
00:41:40,751 -- 00:41:44,879
Then... only then...
a Jedi will you be.

290
00:41:46,632 -- 00:41:48,755
And confront him you will.

291
00:41:53,431 -- 00:41:54,889
Master Yoda...

292
00:41:58,644 -- 00:42:01,052
is Darth Vader my father?

293
00:42:04,191 -- 00:42:06,682
Rest I need.

294
00:42:06,819 -- 00:42:08,230
Yes.

295
00:42:08,362 -- 00:42:09,987
Rest.

296
00:42:11,824 -- 00:42:13,864
Yoda, I must know.

297
00:42:18,205 -- 00:42:20,364
Your father he is.

298
00:42:26,672 -- 00:42:29,210
Told you, did he?

299
00:42:30,968 -- 00:42:32,344
Yes.

300
00:42:34,180 -- 00:42:36,469
Unexpected this is.

301
00:42:38,476 -- 00:42:39,887
And unfortunate.

302
00:42:41,687 -- 00:42:43,727
Unfortunate that I know the truth?

303
00:42:43,856 -- 00:42:45,137
No.

304
00:42:48,361 -- 00:42:52,275
Unfortunate that
you rushed to face him...

305
00:42:52,406 -- 00:42:54,944
that incomplete
was your training...

306
00:42:56,035 -- 00:42:59,534
that not ready
for the burden were you.

307
00:43:01,540 -- 00:43:03,165
I'm sorry.

308
00:43:04,377 -- 00:43:09,881
Remember, a Jedi's strength
flows from the Force.

309
00:43:14,929 -- 00:43:16,672
But beware.

310
00:43:16,806 -- 00:43:20,340
Anger, fear, aggression...

311
00:43:20,476 -- 00:43:23,097
the dark side are they.

312
00:43:23,854 -- 00:43:27,555
Once you start down the dark path...

313
00:43:27,692 -- 00:43:31,440
forever will it dominate your destiny.

314
00:43:38,703 -- 00:43:40,446
Do not...

315
00:43:43,541 -- 00:43:48,037
Do not underestimate
the powers of the emperor...

316
00:43:49,130 -- 00:43:52,581
or suffer your father's fate you will.

317
00:43:57,054 -- 00:43:59,094
When gone am I...

318
00:43:59,974 -- 00:44:03,058
the last of the Jedi will you be.

319
00:44:07,565 -- 00:44:11,645
The Force runs strong in your family.

320
00:44:14,155 -- 00:44:17,737
Pass on what you have learned.

321
00:44:27,585 -- 00:44:29,376
There is...

322
00:44:30,546 -- 00:44:32,206
another...

323
00:44:36,385 -- 00:44:40,715
Skywalker.

324
00:45:41,534 -- 00:45:43,408
I can't do it, R2.

325
00:45:47,290 -- 00:45:49,697
I can't go on alone.

326
00:45:49,834 -- 00:45:51,992
iYoda will always be with you./i

327
00:45:53,087 -- 00:45:54,285
Obi-Wan.

328
00:46:02,346 -- 00:46:03,971
Why didn't you tell me?

329
00:46:04,098 -- 00:46:07,965
You told me Vader betrayed
and murdered my father.

330
00:46:08,102 -- 00:46:13,606
Your father was seduced
by the dark side of the Force.

331
00:46:13,733 -- 00:46:17,647
He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker
and became Darth Vader.

332
00:46:17,778 -- 00:46:19,273
When that happened...

333
00:46:19,405 -- 00:46:22,572
the good man who was
your father was destroyed.

334
00:46:23,618 -- 00:46:26,025
So what I told you was true...

335
00:46:26,162 -- 00:46:27,989
from a certain point of view.

336
00:46:28,122 -- 00:46:30,578
A certain point of view?

337
00:46:30,708 -- 00:46:34,575
Luke, you're going to find
that many of the truths we cling to...

338
00:46:34,712 -- 00:46:37,629
depend greatly
on our own point of view.

339
00:46:38,424 -- 00:46:41,129
Anakin was a good friend.

340
00:46:42,094 -- 00:46:43,672
When I first knew him...

341
00:46:43,804 -- 00:46:45,963
your father was already a great pilot...

342
00:46:46,098 -- 00:46:49,717
but I was amazed how strongly
the Force was with him.

343
00:46:49,852 -- 00:46:53,802
I took it upon myself
to train him as a Jedi.

344
00:46:53,940 -- 00:46:57,854
I thought that I could instruct him
just as well as Yoda.

345
00:46:57,985 -- 00:46:59,266
I was wrong.

346
00:47:00,237 -- 00:47:02,111
There is still good in him.

347
00:47:02,239 -- 00:47:04,991
He's more machine now than man...

348
00:47:05,117 -- 00:47:07,075
twisted and evil.

349
00:47:08,829 -- 00:47:11,036
I can't do it, Ben.

350
00:47:11,165 -- 00:47:13,074
You cannot escape your destiny.

351
00:47:13,209 -- 00:47:16,459
You must face Darth Vader again.

352
00:47:16,587 -- 00:47:19,374
I can't kill my own father.

353
00:47:22,635 -- 00:47:25,719
Then the emperor has already won.

354
00:47:26,764 -- 00:47:29,006
You were our only hope.

355
00:47:30,309 -- 00:47:32,432
Yoda spoke of another.

356
00:47:34,480 -- 00:47:37,053
The other he spoke of
is your twin sister.

357
00:47:37,984 -- 00:47:39,941
But I have no sister.

358
00:47:41,070 -- 00:47:42,979
To protect you both
from the emperor...

359
00:47:43,114 -- 00:47:46,696
you were hidden from your father
when you were born.

360
00:47:46,826 -- 00:47:49,281
The emperor knew, as I did...

361
00:47:49,412 -- 00:47:53,112
if Anakin were to have any offspring...

362
00:47:53,249 -- 00:47:55,787
they would be a threat to him.

363
00:47:55,918 -- 00:48:01,209
That is the reason why your sister
remains safely anonymous.

364
00:48:03,759 -- 00:48:07,709
- Leia is my sister.
- Your insight serves you well.

365
00:48:09,015 -- 00:48:11,885
Bury your feelings deep down, Luke.

366
00:48:12,018 -- 00:48:14,390
They do you credit...

367
00:48:14,520 -- 00:48:17,604
but they could be made
to serve the emperor.

368
00:48:40,087 -- 00:48:42,757
Look at you. A general, huh?

369
00:48:42,882 -- 00:48:45,966
Someone must have told them about
my manoeuvre at the Battle of Tanaab.

370
00:48:46,093 -- 00:48:48,964
Don't look at me, pal.
I just said you were a fair pilot.

371
00:48:49,096 -- 00:48:52,050
I didn't know they were looking for
somebody to lead this crazy attack.

372
00:48:52,183 -- 00:48:54,306
I'm surprised they didn't
ask you to do it.

373
00:48:55,186 -- 00:48:57,143
Who says they didn't?
But I ain't crazy.

374
00:48:57,271 -- 00:48:59,063
You're the respectable one, remember?

375
00:49:07,406 -- 00:49:10,460
The emperor's made a critical error
and the time for our attack has come.

376
00:49:11,160 -- 00:49:15,027
The data brought to us by the Bothan
spies pinpoint the exact location...

377
00:49:15,164 -- 00:49:17,287
of the emperor's new battle station.

378
00:49:17,416 -- 00:49:19,208
We also know
that the weapon systems...

379
00:49:19,335 -- 00:49:21,577
of this Death Star
are not yet operational.

380
00:49:21,712 -- 00:49:24,666
With the imperial fleet
spread throughout the galaxy...

381
00:49:24,799 -- 00:49:26,293
in a vain effort to engage us...

382
00:49:26,425 -- 00:49:28,299
it is relatively unprotected.

383
00:49:28,427 -- 00:49:30,467
But most important of all...

384
00:49:31,389 -- 00:49:33,298
we've learned that
the emperor himself...

385
00:49:33,432 -- 00:49:35,555
is personally overseeing
the final stages...

386
00:49:35,685 -- 00:49:38,140
of the construction
of this Death Star.

387
00:49:39,021 -- 00:49:43,482
Many Bothans died
to bring us this information.

388
00:49:45,638 -- 00:49:47,247
Admiral Ackbar, please.

389
00:49:47,488 -- 00:49:52,613
You can see here the Death Star
orbiting the forest moon of Endor.

390
00:49:52,743 -- 00:49:58,200
Although the weapon systems on this
Death Star are not yet operational...

391
00:49:58,332 -- 00:50:01,832
the Death Star does have
a strong defence mechanism.

392
00:50:03,129 -- 00:50:05,417
It is protected by an energy shield...

393
00:50:05,548 -- 00:50:09,166
which is generated
from the nearby forest moon of Endor.

394
00:50:14,807 -- 00:50:18,556
The shield must be deactivated
if any attack is to be attempted.

395
00:50:19,979 -- 00:50:23,893
Once the shield is down,
our cruisers will create a perimeter...

396
00:50:24,025 -- 00:50:26,942
while the fighters
fly into the superstructure...

397
00:50:27,069 -- 00:50:30,023
and attempt to knock out
the main reactor.

398
00:50:32,908 -- 00:50:35,909
General Calrissian has volunteered
to lead the fighter attack.

399
00:50:36,037 -- 00:50:37,317
Good luck.

400
00:50:39,453 -- 00:50:40,913
You're gonna need it.

401
00:50:41,174 -- 00:50:42,750
General Madine.

402
00:50:43,794 -- 00:50:46,712
We have stolen a small imperial shuttle.

403
00:50:46,839 -- 00:50:51,051
Disguised as a cargo ship
and using a secret imperial code...

404
00:50:51,177 -- 00:50:55,969
a strike team will land on the moon
and deactivate the shield generator.

405
00:50:56,098 -- 00:50:57,343
Sounds dangerous.

406
00:50:57,475 -- 00:50:59,763
Wonder who they found
to pull that off.

407
00:50:59,894 -- 00:51:02,895
General Solo,
is your strike team assembled?

408
00:51:03,689 -- 00:51:06,939
My team's ready. I don't have
a command crew for the shuttle.

409
00:51:08,110 -- 00:51:10,186
It's gonna be rough.
I didn't wanna speak for you.

410
00:51:12,657 -- 00:51:16,606
- That's one.
- General, count me in.

411
00:51:16,744 -- 00:51:18,653
I'm with you too.

412
00:51:24,543 -- 00:51:27,295
- What is it?
- Ask me again sometime.

413
00:51:28,339 -- 00:51:31,044
Hi, Han, Chewie.

414
00:51:32,176 -- 00:51:34,632
Exciting is hardly the word
I would choose.

415
00:51:50,236 -- 00:51:53,272
Look, I want you to take her.

416
00:51:53,406 -- 00:51:54,948
I mean it. Take her.

417
00:51:55,074 -- 00:51:58,490
You need all the help you can get.
She's the fastest ship in the fleet.

418
00:51:58,619 -- 00:52:00,944
All right, old buddy.

419
00:52:01,080 -- 00:52:03,073
I know what she means to you.

420
00:52:03,207 -- 00:52:06,908
I'll take good care of her.
She won't get a scratch.

421
00:52:08,212 -- 00:52:09,623
All right?

422
00:52:09,755 -- 00:52:11,036
Right.

423
00:52:17,930 -- 00:52:20,504
I got your promise.
Not a scratch.

424
00:52:20,641 -- 00:52:22,800
Would you get going, you pirate?

425
00:52:24,562 -- 00:52:25,724
Good luck.

426
00:52:25,855 -- 00:52:27,349
You too.

427
00:52:36,490 -- 00:52:38,448
- Got her warmed?
- Yeah, she's coming up.

428
00:52:41,120 -- 00:52:44,738
I don't think the Empire had Wookiees
in mind when they designed her, Chewie.

429
00:52:55,051 -- 00:52:57,008
Hey, you awake?

430
00:52:57,136 -- 00:53:00,587
Yeah. I just got a funny feeling,
like I'm not gonna see her again.

431
00:53:02,725 -- 00:53:05,097
Come on, General. Let's move.

432
00:53:05,227 -- 00:53:08,561
Right. Chewie, let's see
what this piece of junk can do.

433
00:53:08,689 -- 00:53:10,896
- Ready, everybody?
- All set.

434
00:53:13,444 -- 00:53:15,235
Here we go again.

435
00:53:26,248 -- 00:53:28,158
All right, hang on.

436
00:53:44,475 -- 00:53:46,966
What is thy bidding, my master?

437
00:53:48,020 -- 00:53:51,389
Send the fleet
to the far side of Endor.

438
00:53:54,402 -- 00:53:58,980
There it will stay until called for.

439
00:54:00,366 -- 00:54:04,411
What of the reports of the rebel fleet
massing near Sullust?

440
00:54:04,537 -- 00:54:06,529
It is of no concern.

441
00:54:07,331 -- 00:54:11,578
Soon the rebellion will be crushed
and young Skywalker will be one of us.

442
00:54:11,711 -- 00:54:13,502
Your work here is finished, my friend.

443
00:54:13,629 -- 00:54:16,299
Go out to the command ship
and await my orders.

444
00:54:16,424 -- 00:54:18,333
Yes, my master.

445
00:54:34,066 -- 00:54:37,103
If they don't go for this, we're gonna
have to get out pretty quick.

446
00:54:39,363 -- 00:54:42,033
iWe have you on our screen now./i
iPlease identify./i

447
00:54:43,618 -- 00:54:47,402
Shuttle iTydirium/i requesting
deactivation of the deflector shield.

448
00:54:53,085 -- 00:54:57,130
Shuttle iTydirium,/i transmit
the clearance code for shield passage.

449
00:54:58,549 -- 00:54:59,960
Transmission commencing.

450
00:55:00,092 -- 00:55:03,093
Now we find out if that code
is worth the price we paid.

451
00:55:04,221 -- 00:55:06,380
It'll work. It'll work.

452
00:55:07,767 -- 00:55:09,925
Vader's on that ship.

453
00:55:10,061 -- 00:55:11,887
Don't get jittery, Luke.

454
00:55:12,021 -- 00:55:14,227
There are a lot of command ships.

455
00:55:15,316 -- 00:55:18,899
Keep your distance, Chewie, but don't
look like you're keeping your distance.

456
00:55:20,154 -- 00:55:22,610
I don't know. Fly casual.

457
00:55:27,870 -- 00:55:29,744
Where is that shuttle going?

458
00:55:30,623 -- 00:55:32,912
Shuttle iTydirium,/i
what is your cargo and destination?

459
00:55:34,919 -- 00:55:36,958
iParts and technical crew/i
ifor the forest moon./i

460
00:55:39,173 -- 00:55:41,794
Do they have a code clearance?

461
00:55:42,593 -- 00:55:44,835
It's an older code, sir,
but it checks out.

462
00:55:44,971 -- 00:55:46,928
I was about to clear them.

463
00:55:51,769 -- 00:55:54,011
I'm endangering the mission.
I shouldn't have come.

464
00:55:54,146 -- 00:55:56,435
It's your imagination, kid.

465
00:55:56,565 -- 00:55:59,317
Come on. Let's keep
a little optimism here.

466
00:56:07,451 -- 00:56:08,910
Shall I hold them?

467
00:56:09,996 -- 00:56:12,866
No. Leave them to me.

468
00:56:12,999 -- 00:56:15,287
I will deal with them myself.

469
00:56:16,168 -- 00:56:18,375
As you wish, my lord. Carry on.

470
00:56:20,256 -- 00:56:22,130
They're not going for it, Chewie.

471
00:56:26,345 -- 00:56:28,053
iShuttle/i Tydirium...

472
00:56:28,180 -- 00:56:30,553
ideactivation of the shield/i
iwill commence immediately./i

473
00:56:30,683 -- 00:56:32,972
iFollow your present course./i

474
00:56:33,102 -- 00:56:35,593
Okay. I told you
it was gonna work.

475
00:56:35,730 -- 00:56:36,892
No problem.

476
00:57:10,306 -- 00:57:12,345
I told you it was dangerous here.

477
00:57:27,782 -- 00:57:31,233
- Should we try and go around?
- It'll take time.

478
00:57:31,369 -- 00:57:34,370
This whole party will be
for nothing if they see us.

479
00:57:37,208 -- 00:57:39,497
Chewie and I will take care of this.
You stay here.

480
00:57:39,627 -- 00:57:42,296
Quietly. There might be
more of them out there.

481
00:57:42,421 -- 00:57:43,797
Hey...

482
00:57:43,923 -- 00:57:45,203
it's me.

483
00:58:10,825 -- 00:58:12,817
Go for help! Go!

484
00:58:12,952 -- 00:58:14,446
Great. Come on!

485
00:58:30,011 -- 00:58:31,968
Over there! Two more of them.

486
00:58:33,014 -- 00:58:35,302
I see them. Wait. Leia!

487
00:58:39,186 -- 00:58:40,645
Hey, wait!

488
00:58:46,944 -- 00:58:49,400
Quick, jam their comlink.
Centre switch.

489
00:59:01,042 -- 00:59:02,619
Move closer.

490
00:59:05,087 -- 00:59:06,546
Get alongside that one.

491
00:59:47,964 -- 00:59:50,086
Keep on that one.
I'll take these two.

492
01:02:04,016 -- 01:02:05,760
General Solo, somebody's coming.

493
01:02:19,115 -- 01:02:20,229
Where's Leia?

494
01:02:21,117 -- 01:02:23,524
- She didn't come back?
- I thought she was with you.

495
01:02:23,661 -- 01:02:26,152
We got separated.
We better go look for her.

496
01:02:26,289 -- 01:02:29,325
Take the squad ahead. We'll meet
at the shield generator at 0300.

497
01:02:29,458 -- 01:02:31,498
Come on, R2.
We'll need your scanners.

498
01:02:32,753 -- 01:02:35,375
Don't worry, Master Luke.
We know what to do.

499
01:02:36,882 -- 01:02:39,005
And you said it was pretty here.

500
01:03:01,724 -- 01:03:03,597
Cut it out.

501
01:03:20,451 -- 01:03:22,527
I'm not gonna hurt you.

502
01:03:30,586 -- 01:03:33,255
Well, looks like I'm stuck here.

503
01:03:35,257 -- 01:03:37,546
Trouble is, I don't know where here is.

504
01:03:38,594 -- 01:03:40,551
Maybe you can help me.

505
01:03:41,805 -- 01:03:43,513
Come on. Sit down.

506
01:03:45,559 -- 01:03:47,599
I promise I won't hurt you.
Now come here.

507
01:03:49,355 -- 01:03:51,846
All right.
You want something to eat?

508
01:03:58,614 -- 01:04:00,073
That's right.

509
01:04:04,995 -- 01:04:06,703
Come on.

510
01:04:26,934 -- 01:04:28,309
Look. It's a hat.

511
01:04:28,435 -- 01:04:30,393
It's not gonna hurt you. Look.

512
01:04:37,278 -- 01:04:39,484
You're a jittery little thing,
aren't you?

513
01:04:44,785 -- 01:04:46,327
What is it?

514
01:05:25,951 -- 01:05:27,232
Freeze!

515
01:05:27,369 -- 01:05:29,576
Come on. Get up.

516
01:05:34,001 -- 01:05:36,788
- Get your ride. Take her back to base.
- Yes, sir.

517
01:05:41,592 -- 01:05:42,754
What the...

518
01:05:59,818 -- 01:06:02,392
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

519
01:06:44,405 -- 01:06:47,275
I told you to remain
on the command ship.

520
01:06:48,993 -- 01:06:53,738
A small rebel force has penetrated
the shield and landed on Endor.

521
01:06:55,332 -- 01:06:57,040
Yes, I know.

522
01:06:58,586 -- 01:07:00,792
My son is with them.

523
01:07:02,464 -- 01:07:07,091
- Are you sure?
- I have felt him, my master.

524
01:07:08,554 -- 01:07:11,045
Strange that I have not.

525
01:07:12,641 -- 01:07:17,849
I wonder if your feelings
on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.

526
01:07:17,980 -- 01:07:20,732
They are clear, my master.

527
01:07:20,858 -- 01:07:25,105
Then you must go to
the sanctuary moon and wait for him.

528
01:07:25,237 -- 01:07:28,238
He will come to me?

529
01:07:30,492 -- 01:07:32,818
I have foreseen it.

530
01:07:32,953 -- 01:07:36,998
His compassion for you
will be his undoing.

531
01:07:37,124 -- 01:07:41,038
He will come to you,
and then you will bring him before me.

532
01:07:41,837 -- 01:07:43,379
As you wish.

533
01:08:04,944 -- 01:08:06,354
Master Luke.

534
01:08:10,074 -- 01:08:12,825
There's two more
wrecked speeders back there.

535
01:08:12,952 -- 01:08:14,861
And I found this.

536
01:08:16,372 -- 01:08:20,749
I'm afraid that R2's sensors
can find no trace of Princess Leia.

537
01:08:23,170 -- 01:08:24,795
I hope she's all right.

538
01:08:29,760 -- 01:08:30,875
What, Chewie?

539
01:08:33,555 -- 01:08:35,382
What, Chewie?

540
01:08:49,029 -- 01:08:52,398
I don't get it.
It's just a dead animal.

541
01:08:53,242 -- 01:08:55,116
Chewie, wait! Don't!

542
01:08:59,665 -- 01:09:01,124
Nice work.

543
01:09:02,918 -- 01:09:04,745
Great, Chewie.

544
01:09:04,878 -- 01:09:06,955
Great. Always thinking
with your stomach.

545
01:09:07,089 -- 01:09:10,256
Take it easy. Let's just figure
a way to get out of this thing.

546
01:09:10,384 -- 01:09:12,092
Han, can you reach my lightsabre?

547
01:09:12,219 -- 01:09:13,678
Yeah. Sure.

548
01:09:20,728 -- 01:09:23,266
R2, I'm not sure
that's such a good idea.

549
01:09:23,397 -- 01:09:25,390
It's a very long drop!

550
01:10:08,317 -- 01:10:11,234
Hey. Point that thing
someplace else.

551
01:10:15,783 -- 01:10:16,897
Hey!

552
01:10:17,034 -- 01:10:19,490
Han, don't. It'll be all right.

553
01:10:25,751 -- 01:10:28,207
Chewie, give them your crossbow.

554
01:10:30,297 -- 01:10:31,922
Oh, my head.

555
01:10:36,178 -- 01:10:37,969
Oh, my goodness.

556
01:11:09,795 -- 01:11:11,704
Do you understand
anything they're saying?

557
01:11:11,839 -- 01:11:13,250
Oh, yes, Master Luke.

558
01:11:13,382 -- 01:11:16,169
Remember that I am fluent
in over six million forms...

559
01:11:16,302 -- 01:11:17,926
What are you telling them?

560
01:11:19,138 -- 01:11:21,214
Hello, I think.

561
01:11:21,348 -- 01:11:24,385
I could be mistaken...
they're using a very primitive dialect...

562
01:11:24,518 -- 01:11:28,053
but I do believe they think
I am some sort of god.

563
01:11:32,359 -- 01:11:36,855
Why don't you use your divine
influence and get us out of this?

564
01:11:36,989 -- 01:11:39,860
I beg your pardon, General Solo,
but that just wouldn't be proper.

565
01:11:40,868 -- 01:11:42,243
Proper?

566
01:11:42,369 -- 01:11:44,991
It's against my programming
to impersonate a deity.

567
01:11:45,122 -- 01:11:46,367
Why, you...

568
01:11:54,590 -- 01:11:56,084
My mistake.

569
01:11:57,801 -- 01:11:59,759
He's an old friend of mine.

570
01:12:26,914 -- 01:12:28,289
Hey.

571
01:12:45,474 -- 01:12:47,930
I have a really bad feeling about this.

572
01:13:08,956 -- 01:13:10,534
What did he say?

573
01:13:10,666 -- 01:13:12,991
I'm rather embarrassed,
General Solo...

574
01:13:13,127 -- 01:13:16,626
but it appears you are to be the main
course at a banquet in my honour.

575
01:13:34,148 -- 01:13:36,520
Your Royal Highness.

576
01:13:36,650 -- 01:13:38,394
These are my friends.

577
01:13:41,488 -- 01:13:45,700
3PO, tell them
they must be set free.

578
01:14:03,510 -- 01:14:06,677
Somehow I got the feeling
that didn't help us very much.

579
01:14:06,805 -- 01:14:10,720
3PO, tell them
if they don't do as you wish...

580
01:14:10,851 -- 01:14:12,808
you'll become angry
and use your magic.

581
01:14:12,937 -- 01:14:15,309
But, Master Luke, what magic?
I couldn't possibly...

582
01:14:15,439 -- 01:14:16,981
Tell them.

583
01:14:32,915 -- 01:14:34,991
You see, Master Luke?
They didn't believe me...

584
01:14:35,125 -- 01:14:36,703
just as I said they wouldn't.

585
01:14:36,835 -- 01:14:38,116
Wait.

586
01:14:46,762 -- 01:14:48,636
What's happening?

587
01:14:54,061 -- 01:14:55,769
Put me down!
Help!

588
01:14:55,896 -- 01:14:57,438
Somebody!

589
01:14:57,565 -- 01:14:58,893
Somebody help!

590
01:14:59,024 -- 01:15:01,729
Master Luke! R2, quickly!

591
01:15:33,475 -- 01:15:34,851
Thank goodness.

592
01:15:47,197 -- 01:15:48,857
Thanks, 3PO.

593
01:15:50,117 -- 01:15:52,074
I never knew I had it in me.

594
01:15:59,668 -- 01:16:01,127
...Tatooine...

595
01:16:02,546 -- 01:16:04,954
Princess Leia... R2.

596
01:16:07,134 -- 01:16:08,593
...Darth Vader!

597
01:16:11,722 -- 01:16:13,465
...Death Star.

598
01:16:16,477 -- 01:16:18,719
...Jedi... Obi-Wan Kenobi.

599
01:16:24,318 -- 01:16:26,192
Yes, R2, I was just coming to that.

600
01:16:29,657 -- 01:16:30,657
Master Luke...

601
01:16:37,331 -- 01:16:40,949
i...Millennium Falcon.../i Cloud City.

602
01:16:43,629 -- 01:16:44,708
...Vader!

603
01:16:45,756 -- 01:16:47,001
Han Solo...

604
01:16:49,176 -- 01:16:50,635
...carbon.

605
01:16:52,221 -- 01:16:53,466
...Sarlacc.

606
01:17:15,119 -- 01:17:17,954
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

607
01:17:31,719 -- 01:17:34,388
Wonderful. We are now
a part of the tribe.

608
01:17:35,806 -- 01:17:37,680
Just what I always wanted.

609
01:17:49,486 -- 01:17:51,775
Short help's better than
no help at all, Chewie.

610
01:17:57,411 -- 01:18:00,614
The scouts will show us the quickest
way to the shield generator.

611
01:18:00,748 -- 01:18:02,705
Good. How far is it?

612
01:18:02,833 -- 01:18:04,458
Ask him.

613
01:18:05,669 -- 01:18:07,792
We need some fresh supplies too.

614
01:18:07,922 -- 01:18:09,831
Try and get our weapons back.

615
01:18:11,342 -- 01:18:13,548
Hurry up.
I haven't got all day.

616
01:18:16,055 -- 01:18:17,928
Luke, what's wrong?

617
01:18:19,850 -- 01:18:23,301
Leia, do you remember
your mother...

618
01:18:23,437 -- 01:18:25,477
your real mother?

619
01:18:25,606 -- 01:18:29,105
Just a little bit.
She died when I was very young.

620
01:18:29,235 -- 01:18:31,144
What do you remember?

621
01:18:31,278 -- 01:18:33,852
Just images really. Feelings.

622
01:18:33,989 -- 01:18:35,567
Tell me.

623
01:18:37,284 -- 01:18:40,321
She was... very beautiful.

624
01:18:40,454 -- 01:18:43,075
Kind... but sad.

625
01:18:45,251 -- 01:18:48,038
Why are you asking me this?

626
01:18:48,170 -- 01:18:50,626
I have no memory of my mother.

627
01:18:51,674 -- 01:18:53,666
I never knew her.

628
01:18:55,469 -- 01:18:57,627
Luke, tell me.
What's troubling you?

629
01:19:02,560 -- 01:19:06,343
Vader is here.
Now. On this moon.

630
01:19:07,982 -- 01:19:09,690
How do you know?

631
01:19:09,817 -- 01:19:11,726
I felt his presence.

632
01:19:12,778 -- 01:19:16,028
He's come for me.
He can feel when I'm near.

633
01:19:16,156 -- 01:19:18,030
That's why I have to go.

634
01:19:18,158 -- 01:19:21,610
As long as I stay, I'm endangering
the group and our mission here.

635
01:19:22,663 -- 01:19:25,617
- I have to face him.
- Why?

636
01:19:30,629 -- 01:19:32,503
He's my father.

637
01:19:36,700 -- 01:19:38,242
Your father?

638
01:19:39,536 -- 01:19:43,534
There's more. It won't be easy
for you to hear it, but you must.

639
01:19:43,665 -- 01:19:46,500
If I don't make it back,
you're the only hope for the Alliance.

640
01:19:46,626 -- 01:19:48,121
Don't talk that way.

641
01:19:48,253 -- 01:19:52,749
You have a power I don't understand
and could never have.

642
01:19:52,883 -- 01:19:54,875
You're wrong, Leia.

643
01:19:55,010 -- 01:19:56,837
You have that power too.

644
01:19:56,970 -- 01:20:00,304
In time, you'll learn
to use it as I have.

645
01:20:04,936 -- 01:20:07,178
The Force is strong in my family.

646
01:20:08,732 -- 01:20:10,641
My father has it.

647
01:20:12,069 -- 01:20:13,942
I have it.

648
01:20:14,071 -- 01:20:15,399
And...

649
01:20:16,698 -- 01:20:19,070
my sister has it.

650
01:20:25,374 -- 01:20:28,493
Yes. It's you, Leia.

651
01:20:33,757 -- 01:20:35,381
I know.

652
01:20:38,220 -- 01:20:39,844
Somehow...

653
01:20:41,556 -- 01:20:43,134
I've always known.

654
01:20:43,266 -- 01:20:45,224
Then you know
why I have to face him.

655
01:20:47,354 -- 01:20:49,761
Luke, run away.
Far away.

656
01:20:49,898 -- 01:20:53,232
If he can feel your presence,
then leave this place.

657
01:20:53,360 -- 01:20:56,610
- I wish I could go with you.
- No, you don't.

658
01:20:56,738 -- 01:20:58,695
You've always been strong.

659
01:20:59,991 -- 01:21:02,280
But why must you confront him?

660
01:21:02,411 -- 01:21:06,111
Because there is good in him.
I've felt it.

661
01:21:06,248 -- 01:21:08,240
He won't turn me over
to the emperor.

662
01:21:08,375 -- 01:21:11,495
I can save him. I can turn him
back to the good side.

663
01:21:12,921 -- 01:21:14,712
I have to try.

664
01:21:33,133 -- 01:21:35,042
Hey, what's going on?

665
01:21:36,845 -- 01:21:40,131
Nothing. I just wanna
be alone for a little while.

666
01:21:41,516 -- 01:21:43,141
Nothing?

667
01:21:44,936 -- 01:21:46,846
Tell me.
What's going on?

668
01:21:52,027 -- 01:21:54,185
I can't tell you.

669
01:21:55,822 -- 01:21:58,444
Could you tell Luke?
Is that who you could tell?

670
01:22:16,301 -- 01:22:17,926
I'm sorry.

671
01:22:21,640 -- 01:22:23,348
Hold me.

672
01:23:16,653 -- 01:23:18,527
This is the rebel that surrendered.

673
01:23:18,655 -- 01:23:21,573
Although he denies it,
I believe there may be more of them...

674
01:23:21,700 -- 01:23:24,405
and I request permission
to conduct a further search of the area.

675
01:23:25,495 -- 01:23:28,200
He was armed only with this.

676
01:23:30,208 -- 01:23:31,916
Good work, Commander.

677
01:23:32,044 -- 01:23:33,953
Leave us.

678
01:23:34,087 -- 01:23:37,752
Conduct your search
and bring his companions to me.

679
01:23:39,217 -- 01:23:40,961
Yes, my lord.

680
01:23:42,804 -- 01:23:44,927
The emperor has been expecting you.

681
01:23:46,308 -- 01:23:47,719
I know, Father.

682
01:23:49,227 -- 01:23:51,553
So, you have accepted the truth.

683
01:23:52,731 -- 01:23:56,230
I've accepted the truth that you were
once Anakin Skywalker, my father.

684
01:23:56,360 -- 01:23:59,563
That name no longer
has any meaning for me.

685
01:24:00,364 -- 01:24:03,115
It is the name of your true self.
You've only forgotten.

686
01:24:03,909 -- 01:24:05,533
I know there is good in you.

687
01:24:05,661 -- 01:24:08,282
The emperor hasn't
driven it from you fully.

688
01:24:12,250 -- 01:24:14,457
That was why
you couldn't destroy me.

689
01:24:15,504 -- 01:24:18,042
That's why you won't bring me
to your emperor now.

690
01:24:25,305 -- 01:24:28,342
I see you have constructed
a new lightsabre.

691
01:24:31,979 -- 01:24:34,933
Your skills are complete.

692
01:24:40,153 -- 01:24:44,732
Indeed you are powerful,
as the emperor has foreseen.

693
01:24:49,705 -- 01:24:51,448
Come with me.

694
01:24:53,542 -- 01:24:56,412
Obi-Wan once thought as you do.

695
01:24:57,713 -- 01:25:02,505
You don't know the power
of the dark side.

696
01:25:02,634 -- 01:25:05,386
I must obey my master.

697
01:25:06,471 -- 01:25:09,887
I will not turn,
and you'll be forced to kill me.

698
01:25:11,268 -- 01:25:13,841
If that is your destiny.

699
01:25:13,979 -- 01:25:17,763
Search your feelings, Father.
You can't do this.

700
01:25:17,899 -- 01:25:20,521
I feel the conflict within you.
Let go of your hate.

701
01:25:21,778 -- 01:25:25,194
It is too late for me, son.

702
01:25:28,410 -- 01:25:32,739
The emperor will show you
the true nature of the Force.

703
01:25:32,873 -- 01:25:36,491
He is your master now.

704
01:25:40,547 -- 01:25:42,955
Then my father is truly dead.

705
01:26:25,968 -- 01:26:27,877
The main entrance
to the control bunker...

706
01:26:28,011 -- 01:26:30,004
is on the far side
of that landing platform.

707
01:26:30,889 -- 01:26:34,507
- This isn't gonna be easy.
- Don't worry.

708
01:26:34,768 -- 01:26:38,500
Chewie and me got into a lot of places
more heavily guarded than this.

709
01:26:46,113 -- 01:26:47,737
What's he saying?

710
01:26:47,864 -- 01:26:51,198
He says there's a secret entrance
on the other side of the ridge.

711
01:27:10,429 -- 01:27:13,798
Admiral, we're in position.
All fighters accounted for.

712
01:27:14,683 -- 01:27:16,640
Proceed with the countdown.

713
01:27:17,853 -- 01:27:20,308
All groups assume attack coordinates.

714
01:27:23,692 -- 01:27:25,649
Don't worry.
My friend's down there.

715
01:27:25,777 -- 01:27:28,315
He'll have that shield down on time.

716
01:27:31,283 -- 01:27:33,774
Or this'll be
the shortest offensive of all time.

717
01:27:35,746 -- 01:27:39,446
All craft, prepare to jump
into hyperspace on my mark.

718
01:27:39,583 -- 01:27:41,540
All right. Stand by.

719
01:28:01,146 -- 01:28:03,269
Back door, huh? Good idea.

720
01:28:11,657 -- 01:28:14,611
It's only a few guards.
This shouldn't be too much trouble.

721
01:28:19,790 -- 01:28:22,625
It only takes one to sound the alarm.

722
01:28:22,751 -- 01:28:25,242
Then we'll do it real quiet-like.

723
01:28:25,379 -- 01:28:27,870
- Oh, my. Princess Leia.
- Quiet.

724
01:28:29,216 -- 01:28:31,007
I'm afraid our furry companion...

725
01:28:31,134 -- 01:28:33,257
has gone and done something
rather rash.

726
01:28:38,767 -- 01:28:40,724
There goes our surprise attack.

727
01:28:48,026 -- 01:28:50,268
Look, over there! Stop him!

728
01:29:02,165 -- 01:29:05,202
Not bad for a little furball.
There's only one left.

729
01:29:05,335 -- 01:29:07,791
You stay here.
We'll take care of this.

730
01:29:09,923 -- 01:29:12,130
I have decided that we shall stay here.

731
01:29:41,997 -- 01:29:42,997
Hey!

732
01:30:47,145 -- 01:30:49,933
Welcome, young Skywalker.

733
01:30:50,065 -- 01:30:52,390
I have been expecting you.

734
01:30:53,443 -- 01:30:55,401
You'll no longer need those.

735
01:31:00,867 -- 01:31:02,741
Guards, leave us.

736
01:31:10,168 -- 01:31:13,620
I'm looking forward
to completing your training.

737
01:31:13,755 -- 01:31:18,832
In time, you will call me master.

738
01:31:18,969 -- 01:31:21,424
You're gravely mistaken.

739
01:31:21,555 -- 01:31:23,678
You won't convert me
as you did my father.

740
01:31:24,558 -- 01:31:28,306
Oh, no, my young Jedi.

741
01:31:30,439 -- 01:31:34,519
You will find that
it is you who are mistaken...

742
01:31:35,944 -- 01:31:40,072
about a great many things.

743
01:31:41,783 -- 01:31:43,408
His lightsabre.

744
01:31:43,535 -- 01:31:47,200
Ah, yes. A Jedi's weapon.

745
01:31:47,998 -- 01:31:50,406
Much like your father's.

746
01:31:50,542 -- 01:31:55,334
By now you must know your father
can never be turned from the dark side.

747
01:31:55,464 -- 01:31:58,299
So will it be with you.

748
01:31:58,425 -- 01:32:00,465
You're wrong.

749
01:32:00,594 -- 01:32:03,678
Soon I'll be dead...
and you with me.

750
01:32:07,142 -- 01:32:11,436
Perhaps you refer to
the imminent attack of your rebel fleet.

751
01:32:12,272 -- 01:32:13,683
Yes.

752
01:32:13,815 -- 01:32:18,940
I assure you we are quite safe
from your friends here.

753
01:32:20,113 -- 01:32:22,984
Your overconfidence
is your weakness.

754
01:32:23,116 -- 01:32:26,236
Your faith in your friends is yours.

755
01:32:28,789 -- 01:32:32,371
It is pointless to resist, my son.

756
01:32:36,421 -- 01:32:41,878
Everything that has transpired
has done so according to my design.

757
01:32:42,010 -- 01:32:45,213
Your friends up there
on the sanctuary moon...

758
01:32:45,347 -- 01:32:49,676
are walking into a trap,
as is your rebel fleet.

759
01:32:51,603 -- 01:32:54,094
It was I who allowed the Alliance...

760
01:32:54,231 -- 01:32:57,647
to know the location
of the shield generator.

761
01:32:57,776 -- 01:33:01,821
It is quite safe
from your pitiful little band.

762
01:33:01,947 -- 01:33:06,194
An entire legion
of my best troops awaits them.

763
01:33:08,704 -- 01:33:12,452
I'm afraid the deflector shield...

764
01:33:12,582 -- 01:33:17,790
will be quite operational
when your friends arrive.

765
01:33:21,341 -- 01:33:22,670
All right!

766
01:33:22,801 -- 01:33:24,295
Up! Move!

767
01:33:24,428 -- 01:33:25,886
Quickly. Quickly.

768
01:33:30,392 -- 01:33:32,016
Han, hurry.

769
01:33:32,144 -- 01:33:34,017
The fleet will be here any moment.

770
01:33:35,731 -- 01:33:37,972
Charges. Come on. Come on!

771
01:33:40,110 -- 01:33:41,937
Oh, my. They'll be captured.

772
01:33:44,823 -- 01:33:46,531
Wait! Come back!

773
01:33:49,036 -- 01:33:50,827
R2, stay with me.

774
01:33:51,872 -- 01:33:53,496
Freeze!

775
01:33:56,877 -- 01:33:58,834
You rebel scum.

776
01:34:18,523 -- 01:34:21,892
- All wings report in.
- Red Leader standing by.

777
01:34:22,027 -- 01:34:25,194
- Grey Leader standing by.
- Green Leader standing by.

778
01:34:26,073 -- 01:34:28,196
Lock S-foils in attack positions.

779
01:34:31,870 -- 01:34:33,993
May the Force be with us.

780
01:34:37,584 -- 01:34:40,585
We've gotta be able to get
a reading on that shield... up or down.

781
01:34:42,255 -- 01:34:44,925
How could they be jamming us
if they don't know...

782
01:34:45,968 -- 01:34:47,545
if we're coming.

783
01:34:47,678 -- 01:34:51,177
Break off the attack.
The shield is still up.

784
01:34:51,306 -- 01:34:53,382
I get no reading. You sure?

785
01:34:53,517 -- 01:34:55,675
iPull up! All craft pull up!/i

786
01:35:00,190 -- 01:35:04,140
Take evasive action. Green Group,
stick close to Holding Sector MV-7.

787
01:35:05,988 -- 01:35:08,739
Admiral, we have
enemy ships in Sector 47.

788
01:35:08,865 -- 01:35:10,360
It's a trap.

789
01:35:13,954 -- 01:35:15,911
Fighters coming in.

790
01:35:19,376 -- 01:35:20,704
There's too many.

791
01:35:24,047 -- 01:35:27,416
Accelerate to attack speed.
Draw their fire away from the cruisers.

792
01:35:27,551 -- 01:35:28,582
Copy, Gold Leader.

793
01:35:32,014 -- 01:35:33,508
Come, boy.

794
01:35:34,391 -- 01:35:36,348
See for yourself.

795
01:35:39,021 -- 01:35:44,228
From here, you will witness
the final destruction of the Alliance...

796
01:35:44,359 -- 01:35:48,191
and the end
of your insignificant rebellion.

797
01:35:53,452 -- 01:35:55,777
You want this...

798
01:35:56,580 -- 01:35:58,454
don't you?

799
01:35:58,582 -- 01:36:03,078
The hate is swelling in you now.

800
01:36:03,879 -- 01:36:06,037
Take your Jedi weapon.

801
01:36:06,173 -- 01:36:07,916
Use it.

802
01:36:08,050 -- 01:36:10,007
I am unarmed.

803
01:36:10,135 -- 01:36:12,009
Strike me down with it.

804
01:36:12,137 -- 01:36:14,675
Give in to your anger.

805
01:36:15,724 -- 01:36:20,849
With each passing moment
you make yourself more my servant.

806
01:36:27,444 -- 01:36:29,484
It is unavoidable.

807
01:36:30,572 -- 01:36:32,695
It is your destiny.

808
01:36:33,742 -- 01:36:36,862
You, like your father...

809
01:36:36,995 -- 01:36:38,620
are now...

810
01:36:39,539 -- 01:36:41,164
mine.

811
01:36:59,125 -- 01:37:00,824
All right, move it.

812
01:37:09,653 -- 01:37:11,752
Hello. I say, over there.

813
01:37:12,239 -- 01:37:14,397
Were you looking for me?

814
01:37:15,942 -- 01:37:17,982
Bring those two down here.

815
01:37:25,619 -- 01:37:29,913
They're on their way.
R2, are you sure this was a good idea?

816
01:37:30,040 -- 01:37:31,368
Freeze.

817
01:37:31,500 -- 01:37:32,614
Don't move.

818
01:37:32,751 -- 01:37:34,660
We surrender.

819
01:39:40,337 -- 01:39:42,210
The code's changed.

820
01:39:42,339 -- 01:39:44,711
- We need R2.
- Here's the terminal.

821
01:39:44,841 -- 01:39:46,834
R2, where are you?

822
01:39:46,968 -- 01:39:48,925
We need you at the bunker
right away.

823
01:39:51,014 -- 01:39:52,508
Going? What do you mean?

824
01:39:54,426 -- 01:39:56,050
Going where, R2?

825
01:39:56,177 -- 01:40:00,389
Wait. R2, this is
no time for heroics.

826
01:40:00,515 -- 01:40:02,175
Come back!

827
01:40:28,418 -- 01:40:30,209
Watch yourself, Wedge.
Three from above.

828
01:40:30,336 -- 01:40:33,254
- Red Three, Red Two, pull in.
- Got it.

829
01:40:36,509 -- 01:40:38,253
Three of them coming in, 20 degrees.

830
01:40:38,386 -- 01:40:40,094
Cut left.
I'll take the leader.

831
01:40:48,438 -- 01:40:50,181
They're heading
for the medical frigate.

832
01:40:55,195 -- 01:40:56,393
Pressure's steady.

833
01:41:05,580 -- 01:41:08,866
Only the fighters are attacking.
What are the Stardestroyers waiting for?

834
01:41:13,305 -- 01:41:15,013
We're in attack position, sir.

835
01:41:15,140 -- 01:41:18,307
- Hold here.
- We're not going to attack?

836
01:41:18,435 -- 01:41:21,720
My orders are from the emperor himself.
He has something special planned.

837
01:41:21,855 -- 01:41:23,764
We only need to
keep them from escaping.

838
01:41:25,484 -- 01:41:29,564
As you can see,
my young apprentice...

839
01:41:29,696 -- 01:41:32,946
your friends have failed.

840
01:41:33,742 -- 01:41:36,114
Now witness the firepower...

841
01:41:36,244 -- 01:41:41,583
of this fully armed
and operational battle station.

842
01:41:42,751 -- 01:41:45,289
Fire at will, Commander.

843
01:41:52,302 -- 01:41:54,010
Fire.

844
01:42:00,644 -- 01:42:03,182
That blast came from the Death Star.

845
01:42:04,147 -- 01:42:06,472
That thing's operational.

846
01:42:06,608 -- 01:42:08,435
Home 1, this is Gold Leader.

847
01:42:08,568 -- 01:42:10,644
We saw it.
All craft prepare to retreat.

848
01:42:10,779 -- 01:42:12,985
You won't get
another chance at this, Admiral.

849
01:42:13,114 -- 01:42:15,866
We have no choice, General Calrissian.

850
01:42:15,992 -- 01:42:19,278
Our cruisers can't repel
firepower of that magnitude.

851
01:42:19,412 -- 01:42:23,113
Han will have that shield down.
We've gotta give him more time.

852
01:42:41,935 -- 01:42:43,346
We're coming.

853
01:42:49,234 -- 01:42:50,562
Come on.

854
01:42:54,364 -- 01:42:55,739
R2, hurry!

855
01:43:01,788 -- 01:43:02,788
My goodness!

856
01:43:08,837 -- 01:43:10,829
Why did you have to be so brave?

857
01:43:14,009 -- 01:43:16,547
Well, I suppose I could
hot-wire this thing.

858
01:43:16,678 -- 01:43:18,137
I'll cover you.

859
01:43:59,721 -- 01:44:02,177
Yes, I said closer.
Move as close as you can...

860
01:44:02,307 -- 01:44:05,012
and engage those Stardestroyers
at point-blank range.

861
01:44:05,143 -- 01:44:08,559
At that close range, we won't last long
against those Stardestroyers.

862
01:44:08,688 -- 01:44:11,310
We'll last longer than we will
against that Death Star...

863
01:44:11,441 -- 01:44:13,683
and we might
take a few of them with us.

864
01:44:16,613 -- 01:44:17,941
She's gonna blow!

865
01:44:22,035 -- 01:44:23,613
I'm hit!

866
01:44:28,792 -- 01:44:30,950
Your fleet is lost...

867
01:44:31,086 -- 01:44:35,130
and your friends on the Endor moon
will not survive.

868
01:44:37,425 -- 01:44:39,833
There is no escape...

869
01:44:39,970 -- 01:44:42,591
my young apprentice.

870
01:44:44,808 -- 01:44:47,263
The Alliance will die...

871
01:44:49,146 -- 01:44:51,981
as will your friends.

872
01:44:55,610 -- 01:44:56,891
Good.

873
01:44:57,904 -- 01:45:01,154
I can feel your anger.

874
01:45:02,909 -- 01:45:06,409
I am defenceless.
Take your weapon.

875
01:45:06,538 -- 01:45:09,658
Strike me down
with all of your hatred...

876
01:45:09,791 -- 01:45:14,287
and your journey towards
the dark side will be complete.

877
01:45:53,585 -- 01:45:55,624
- Look!
- Get him off of there.

878
01:47:48,783 -- 01:47:50,776
I think I got it.

879
01:47:50,911 -- 01:47:52,156
I got it!

880
01:47:59,461 -- 01:48:00,741
Are you all right?

881
01:48:00,879 -- 01:48:02,753
- Let's see.
- It's not bad.

882
01:48:02,881 -- 01:48:04,161
- Freeze!
- Oh, dear.

883
01:48:04,515 -- 01:48:05,793
Don't move.

884
01:48:10,263 -- 01:48:12,968
- I love you.
- I know.

885
01:48:13,499 -- 01:48:14,617
Hands up.

886
01:48:16,069 -- 01:48:17,187
Stand up.

887
01:48:26,613 -- 01:48:28,072
Stay back.

888
01:48:35,997 -- 01:48:38,702
Get down here.
She's wounded.

889
01:48:38,834 -- 01:48:40,660
No, wait.

890
01:48:40,794 -- 01:48:42,371
I got an idea.

891
01:48:53,682 -- 01:48:55,176
Good.

892
01:48:55,308 -- 01:48:59,092
Use your aggressive feelings, boy.

893
01:48:59,229 -- 01:49:01,934
Let the hate flow through you.

894
01:49:07,612 -- 01:49:11,195
Obi-Wan has taught you well.

895
01:49:14,661 -- 01:49:17,033
I will not fight you, Father.

896
01:49:31,136 -- 01:49:33,923
You are unwise
to lower your defences.

897
01:49:58,872 -- 01:50:01,280
Your thoughts betray you, Father.

898
01:50:01,416 -- 01:50:04,536
I feel the good in you, the conflict.

899
01:50:04,669 -- 01:50:07,125
There is no conflict.

900
01:50:09,508 -- 01:50:11,493
You couldn't bring yourself
to kill me before...

901
01:50:11,593 -- 01:50:13,550
and I don't believe
you'll destroy me now.

902
01:50:13,678 -- 01:50:18,221
You underestimate
the power of the dark side.

903
01:50:18,350 -- 01:50:20,177
If you will not fight...

904
01:50:20,310 -- 01:50:22,883
then you will meet your destiny.

905
01:50:34,366 -- 01:50:35,564
Good.

906
01:50:35,700 -- 01:50:37,111
Good.

907
01:50:45,794 -- 01:50:49,412
- Watch out. Squad at.06.
- I'm on it, Gold Leader.

908
01:50:51,341 -- 01:50:52,752
Good shot, Red Two.

909
01:50:56,388 -- 01:50:59,472
We're sure in the middle of it now.
Come on, Han, old buddy.

910
01:50:59,599 -- 01:51:01,259
Don't let me down.

911
01:51:05,814 -- 01:51:07,273
iIt's over, Commander./i

912
01:51:07,399 -- 01:51:09,724
iThe rebels have been routed./i
iThey're fleeing./i

913
01:51:09,860 -- 01:51:12,398
iWe need reinforcements/i
ito continue the pursuit./i

914
01:51:13,488 -- 01:51:15,445
Send three squads to help.

915
01:51:15,574 -- 01:51:17,531
- Open the back door.
- Sir.

916
01:51:31,715 -- 01:51:33,126
Throw me another charge.

917
01:51:50,692 -- 01:51:53,479
You cannot hide forever, Luke.

918
01:51:54,738 -- 01:51:56,647
I will not fight you.

919
01:52:00,160 -- 01:52:03,196
Give yourself to the dark side.

920
01:52:04,789 -- 01:52:08,834
It is the only way
you can save your friends.

921
01:52:09,878 -- 01:52:11,586
Yes.

922
01:52:11,713 -- 01:52:13,670
Your thoughts betray you.

923
01:52:13,798 -- 01:52:16,336
Your feelings for them are strong...

924
01:52:16,468 -- 01:52:18,342
especially for...

925
01:52:20,514 -- 01:52:22,174
sister.

926
01:52:23,433 -- 01:52:27,762
So you have a twin sister.

927
01:52:27,896 -- 01:52:31,596
Your feelings have now
betrayed her too.

928
01:52:31,733 -- 01:52:35,813
Obi-Wan was wise
to hide her from me.

929
01:52:35,946 -- 01:52:40,323
Now his failure is complete.

930
01:52:41,827 -- 01:52:45,611
If you will not turn
to the dark side...

931
01:52:45,747 -- 01:52:48,534
then perhaps she will.

932
01:52:48,667 -- 01:52:49,976
Never!

933
01:53:35,213 -- 01:53:36,921
Good!

934
01:53:41,261 -- 01:53:43,966
Your hate has made you powerful.

935
01:53:45,265 -- 01:53:50,141
Now, fulfil your destiny...

936
01:53:50,270 -- 01:53:54,350
and take your father's place at my side.

937
01:54:09,414 -- 01:54:10,743
Never.

938
01:54:13,793 -- 01:54:15,952
I'll never turn to the dark side.

939
01:54:19,169 -- 01:54:21,759
You've failed, Your Highness.

940
01:54:21,885 -- 01:54:23,842
I am a Jedi...

941
01:54:23,970 -- 01:54:26,010
like my father before me.

942
01:54:33,605 -- 01:54:37,056
So be it, Jedi.

943
01:54:37,275 -- 01:54:39,149
Move! Move!

944
01:54:51,790 -- 01:54:55,657
The shield is down. Commence attack
on the Death Star's main reactor.

945
01:54:55,794 -- 01:54:59,542
We're on our way. Red Group,
Gold Group, all fighters follow me.

946
01:54:59,673 -- 01:55:01,582
I told you they'd do it.

947
01:55:08,723 -- 01:55:11,345
If you will not be turned...

948
01:55:11,476 -- 01:55:14,810
you will be destroyed.

949
01:55:21,987 -- 01:55:23,564
Young fool.

950
01:55:24,656 -- 01:55:27,361
Only now, at the end...

951
01:55:27,492 -- 01:55:29,366
do you understand.

952
01:55:42,591 -- 01:55:48,344
Your feeble skills are no match
for the power of the dark side.

953
01:55:52,184 -- 01:55:56,016
You have paid the price
for your lack of vision.

954
01:56:01,610 -- 01:56:03,436
Father, please!

955
01:56:18,752 -- 01:56:20,910
Now, young Skywalker...

956
01:56:23,048 -- 01:56:24,875
you will die.

957
01:57:47,632 -- 01:57:49,091
I'm going in.

958
01:57:52,262 -- 01:57:53,460
Here goes nothing.

959
01:58:00,562 -- 01:58:04,429
Lock onto the strongest power source.
It should be the power generator.

960
01:58:06,651 -- 01:58:10,103
Form up. Stay alert.
We could run out of space real fast.

961
01:58:25,795 -- 01:58:27,788
Split up and head back to the surface.

962
01:58:27,923 -- 01:58:31,089
See if you can get a few
of those TIE fighters to follow you.

963
01:58:31,218 -- 01:58:32,218
Copy, Gold Leader.

964
01:58:42,479 -- 01:58:44,056
That was too close.

965
01:58:48,068 -- 01:58:50,226
We've got to give
those fighters more time.

966
01:58:50,362 -- 01:58:53,398
Concentrate all fire
on that Super Stardestroyer.

967
01:58:59,538 -- 01:59:01,661
Sir, we've lost our
bridge deflector shields.

968
01:59:01,790 -- 01:59:04,791
Intensify the forward batteries.
I don't want anything to get through.

969
01:59:07,295 -- 01:59:09,039
Intensify forward firepower!

970
01:59:10,882 -- 01:59:12,080
Too late!

971
01:59:57,179 -- 02:00:01,046
Help me take this mask off.

972
02:00:01,183 -- 02:00:03,056
But you'll die.

973
02:00:03,935 -- 02:00:07,435
Nothing can stop that now.

974
02:00:08,523 -- 02:00:10,148
Just for once...

975
02:00:11,109 -- 02:00:12,734
let me...

976
02:00:12,861 -- 02:00:16,312
look on you with my own eyes.

977
02:00:52,567 -- 02:00:56,945
Now go, my son.

978
02:00:58,657 -- 02:01:00,067
Leave me.

979
02:01:01,159 -- 02:01:03,615
No. You're coming with me.

980
02:01:03,745 -- 02:01:06,070
I'll not leave you here.
I've got to save you.

981
02:01:06,957 -- 02:01:10,657
You already have, Luke.

982
02:01:11,837 -- 02:01:13,710
You were right.

983
02:01:14,506 -- 02:01:16,831
You were right about me.

984
02:01:18,760 -- 02:01:20,551
Tell your sister...

985
02:01:21,596 -- 02:01:23,803
you were right.

986
02:01:30,897 -- 02:01:31,976
Father.

987
02:01:36,319 -- 02:01:37,648
I won't leave you.

988
02:02:03,096 -- 02:02:04,096
There it is.

989
02:02:07,058 -- 02:02:09,431
Wedge, go for the power regulator
on the north tower.

990
02:02:09,561 -- 02:02:12,846
Copy, Gold Leader.
I'm already on my way out.

991
02:02:32,083 -- 02:02:35,203
Move the fleet
away from the Death Star.

992
02:03:22,691 -- 02:03:24,085
They did it!

993
02:03:32,561 -- 02:03:34,968
I'm sure Luke wasn't
on that thing when it blew.

994
02:03:36,631 -- 02:03:38,458
He wasn't.

995
02:03:38,592 -- 02:03:40,252
I can feel it.

996
02:03:45,100 -- 02:03:46,678
You love him.

997
02:03:50,105 -- 02:03:51,516
Don't you?

998
02:03:51,649 -- 02:03:53,107
Yes.

999
02:03:53,234 -- 02:03:55,938
All right. I understand.

1000
02:03:56,070 -- 02:03:57,445
Fine.

1001
02:03:58,489 -- 02:04:00,280
When he comes back...

1002
02:04:01,367 -- 02:04:03,110
I won't get in the way.

1003
02:04:05,829 -- 02:04:07,787
It's not like that at all.

1004
02:04:11,357 -- 02:04:13,122
He's my brother.

1005
02:05:54,954 -- 02:05:57,064
Wesa free!

3
00:03:35,632 -- 00:03:37,550
Han, old buddy, do you read me?

4
00:03:37,634 -- 00:03:39,552
iLoud and clear, kid. What's up?/i

5
00:03:39,678 -- 00:03:40,679
I finished my circle.

6
00:03:40,762 -- 00:03:42,472
I don't pick up any life readings.

7
00:03:42,555 -- 00:03:45,558
iThere isn't enough life on this ice cube
to fill a space cruiser./i

8
00:03:45,642 -- 00:03:47,477
iSensors are placed. I'm going back./i

9
00:03:47,811 -- 00:03:49,437
Right. I'll see you shortly.

10
00:03:49,521 -- 00:03:51,398
There's a meteorite
that hit the ground near here.

11
00:03:51,481 -- 00:03:53,650
I want to check it out.
It won't take long.

12
00:03:55,235 -- 00:03:58,488
Steady, girl. What's the matter?

13
00:03:58,571 -- 00:03:59,864
You smell something?

14
00:04:40,864 -- 00:04:42,032
Chewie!

15
00:04:42,115 -- 00:04:44,200
Chewie?

16
00:04:45,035 -- 00:04:46,286
Chewie!

17
00:04:49,622 -- 00:04:51,249
All right! Don't lose your temper.

18
00:04:51,332 -- 00:04:52,959
I'll come right back
and give you a hand.

19
00:05:14,272 -- 00:05:15,273
Solo?

20
00:05:15,482 -- 00:05:16,941
No sign of life out there, General.

21
00:05:17,025 -- 00:05:18,318
The sensors are in place.

22
00:05:18,401 -- 00:05:19,527
You'll know if anything comes around.

23
00:05:19,611 -- 00:05:21,071
Commander Skywalker
reported in yet?

24
00:05:21,154 -- 00:05:23,490
No. He's checking out
a meteorite that hit near him.

25
00:05:24,032 -- 00:05:25,617
With all the meteor activity
in this system,

26
00:05:25,700 -- 00:05:27,452
it's going to be difficult to spot
approaching ships.

27
00:05:27,786 -- 00:05:29,996
General, I got to leave.
I can't stay any more.

28
00:05:30,371 -- 00:05:31,372
I'm sorry to hear that.

29
00:05:31,456 -- 00:05:32,540
Well, there's a price on my head.

30
00:05:32,624 -- 00:05:34,125
If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt,

31
00:05:34,209 -- 00:05:35,418
I'm a dead man.

32
00:05:35,502 -- 00:05:37,587
A death mark's
not an easy thing to live with.

33
00:05:38,758 -- 00:05:39,925
You're a good fighter, Solo.

34
00:05:40,009 -- 00:05:41,177
I hate to lose you.

35
00:05:41,260 -- 00:05:42,553
Thank you, General.

36
00:05:51,020 -- 00:05:52,980
Well, Your Highness, guess this is it.

37
00:05:53,898 -- 00:05:55,191
That's right.

38
00:05:57,735 -- 00:06:00,321
Well, don't get all mushy on me.
So long, Princess.

39
00:06:02,948 -- 00:06:04,158
Han!

40
00:06:05,785 -- 00:06:07,703
Yes, Your Highnessness?

41
00:06:07,787 -- 00:06:09,288
I thought you had decided to stay.

42
00:06:09,371 -- 00:06:12,124
Well, the bounty hunter we ran into
in Ord Mantell changed my mind.

43
00:06:12,208 -- 00:06:14,168
Han, we need you!

44
00:06:14,627 -- 00:06:16,045
- We need?
- Yes.

45
00:06:16,796 -- 00:06:17,963
Well, what about you need?

46
00:06:18,047 -- 00:06:19,048
I need?

47
00:06:19,131 -- 00:06:21,342
I don't know what you're talking about.

48
00:06:21,801 -- 00:06:23,219
You probably don't.

49
00:06:23,469 -- 00:06:25,304
And what precisely
am I supposed to know?

50
00:06:25,596 -- 00:06:26,847
Come on!

51
00:06:26,931 -- 00:06:29,141
You want me to stay
because of the way you feel about me.

52
00:06:29,225 -- 00:06:31,936
Yes! You're a great help to us.
You're a natural leader.

53
00:06:32,019 -- 00:06:34,688
No! That's not it.

54
00:06:34,772 -- 00:06:36,107
Come on.

55
00:06:36,607 -- 00:06:37,900
A-ha!

56
00:06:37,983 -- 00:06:39,360
- Come on.
- You're imagining things.

57
00:06:39,443 -- 00:06:41,237
Am I? Then why are you following me?

58
00:06:41,320 -- 00:06:43,906
Afraid I was gonna leave
without giving you a good-bye kiss?

59
00:06:43,989 -- 00:06:45,032
I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee!

60
00:06:45,116 -- 00:06:46,408
I can arrange that.

61
00:06:46,575 -- 00:06:48,577
You could use a good kiss!

62
00:06:49,829 -- 00:06:50,913
Don't try to blame me.

63
00:06:50,996 -- 00:06:52,623
I didn't ask you to turn on
the thermal heater.

64
00:06:52,706 -- 00:06:55,668
I merely commented that it was freezing
in the princess' chamber.

65
00:06:55,751 -- 00:06:58,045
But it's supposed to be freezing.

66
00:06:58,129 -- 00:06:59,839
How we're going to dry out
all her clothes, I really don't know.

67
00:07:01,006 -- 00:07:02,424
Oh, switch off!

68
00:07:02,508 -- 00:07:03,509
Why did you take this apart now?

69
00:07:03,592 -- 00:07:05,427
I'm trying to get us out of here,
and you pull both...

70
00:07:05,511 -- 00:07:06,512
Excuse me, sir.

71
00:07:06,595 -- 00:07:07,596
Put them back together now!

72
00:07:07,680 -- 00:07:09,223
Might I have a word with you, please?

73
00:07:09,306 -- 00:07:10,891
- What do you want?
- Well, it's Princess Leia, sir.

74
00:07:10,975 -- 00:07:12,560
She's been trying to get you
on the communicator.

75
00:07:12,643 -- 00:07:14,520
I turned it off.
I don't want to talk to her.

76
00:07:14,603 -- 00:07:16,981
Well, Princess Leia
is wondering about Master Luke.

77
00:07:17,064 -- 00:07:18,691
He hasn't come back yet.
She doesn't know where he is.

78
00:07:18,774 -- 00:07:20,651
- I don't know where he is.
- Nobody knows where he is.

79
00:07:20,901 -- 00:07:22,236
What do you mean, nobody knows?

80
00:07:22,319 -- 00:07:24,238
- Well, uh, you see...
- Deck Officer!

81
00:07:24,321 -- 00:07:26,198
- Deck Officer!
- Excuse me, sir, might I...

82
00:07:26,282 -- 00:07:27,283
Yes, sir?

83
00:07:27,366 -- 00:07:28,784
Do you know
where Commander Skywalker is?

84
00:07:28,868 -- 00:07:29,869
I haven't seen him.

85
00:07:29,952 -- 00:07:31,579
It's possible he came in through
the south entrance.

86
00:07:31,662 -- 00:07:34,123
It's possible?
Why don't you go find out?

87
00:07:34,206 -- 00:07:35,291
It's getting dark out there.

88
00:07:35,374 -- 00:07:36,625
Yes, sir.

89
00:07:36,750 -- 00:07:38,878
Excuse me, sir.
Might I inquire what's going on?

90
00:07:38,961 -- 00:07:40,087
Why not?

91
00:07:40,337 -- 00:07:41,463
Impossible man.

92
00:07:41,547 -- 00:07:43,340
Come along, R2,
let's find Princess Leia.

93
00:07:43,424 -- 00:07:46,844
Between ourselves, I think
Master Luke is in considerable danger.

94
00:07:56,520 -- 00:07:58,689
Sir, Commander Skywalker
hasn't come in the south entrance.

95
00:07:58,772 -- 00:07:59,982
He might have forgotten to check in.

96
00:08:00,065 -- 00:08:01,150
Not likely. Are the speeders ready?

97
00:08:01,233 -- 00:08:03,569
Uh, not yet. We're having trouble
adapting them to the cold.

98
00:08:03,652 -- 00:08:04,737
We'll have to go out on tauntauns.

99
00:08:04,820 -- 00:08:06,572
Sir, the temperature's
dropping too rapidly.

100
00:08:06,655 -- 00:08:08,115
That's right,
and my friend's out in it.

101
00:08:13,329 -- 00:08:15,789
Your tauntaun will freeze
before you reach the first marker.

102
00:08:15,873 -- 00:08:17,875
Then I'll see you in hell. Hyah!

103
00:10:35,971 -- 00:10:37,723
You must come along now, R2.

104
00:10:37,806 -- 00:10:39,850
There's really nothing more we can do.

105
00:10:39,933 -- 00:10:42,144
And my joints are freezing up.

106
00:10:43,312 -- 00:10:44,730
Don't say things like that!

107
00:10:44,813 -- 00:10:46,190
Of course we'll see Master Luke again.

108
00:10:47,399 -- 00:10:49,777
And he'll be quite all right.
You'll see.

109
00:10:49,860 -- 00:10:51,737
Stupid little short circuit.

110
00:10:52,154 -- 00:10:53,781
He'll be quite all right.

111
00:11:51,463 -- 00:11:53,465
Sir, all the patrols are in.

112
00:11:53,549 -- 00:11:54,550
Still no...

113
00:11:55,759 -- 00:11:58,262
Still no contact from Skywalker or Solo.

114
00:11:58,679 -- 00:12:02,099
Mistress Leia, R2 says he's been
quite unable to pick up any signals,

115
00:12:02,516 -- 00:12:04,810
although he does admit
that his own range

116
00:12:04,893 -- 00:12:06,353
is far too weak to abandon all hope.

117
00:12:06,437 -- 00:12:08,272
Your Highness,
there's nothing more we can do tonight.

118
00:12:08,355 -- 00:12:10,774
The shield doors must be closed.

119
00:12:12,359 -- 00:12:13,360
Close the doors.

120
00:12:13,444 -- 00:12:14,445
Yes, sir.

121
00:12:16,238 -- 00:12:20,659
R2 says the chances of survival
are 725 to 1.

122
00:12:32,337 -- 00:12:35,883
Actually, R2 has been known
to make mistakes...

123
00:12:38,886 -- 00:12:40,179
from time to time.

124
00:12:40,679 -- 00:12:42,055
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

125
00:12:46,018 -- 00:12:47,102
Don't worry about Master Luke.

126
00:12:47,186 -- 00:12:48,604
I'm sure he'll be all right.

127
00:12:48,687 -- 00:12:51,064
He's quite clever, you know,
for a human being.

128
00:13:07,289 -- 00:13:08,624
iLuke./i

129
00:13:10,959 -- 00:13:12,252
Luke.

130
00:13:19,843 -- 00:13:21,261
Ben?

131
00:13:21,345 -- 00:13:24,056
You will go to the Dagobah system.

132
00:13:24,598 -- 00:13:25,974
Dagobah system?

133
00:13:26,558 -- 00:13:29,144
There you will learn from Yoda,

134
00:13:29,728 -- 00:13:32,814
the Jedi master who instructed me.

135
00:13:34,399 -- 00:13:35,484
Ben!

136
00:13:36,151 -- 00:13:37,152
Ben.

137
00:13:41,907 -- 00:13:43,242
Luke!

138
00:13:43,617 -- 00:13:44,701
Luke!

139
00:13:51,833 -- 00:13:53,752
Don't do this, Luke.

140
00:13:53,835 -- 00:13:55,754
Come on, give me a sign here.

141
00:14:18,902 -- 00:14:20,696
Not much time.

142
00:14:20,779 -- 00:14:21,947
Ben.

143
00:14:22,030 -- 00:14:23,407
Ben.

144
00:14:28,036 -- 00:14:29,705
Hang on, kid.

145
00:14:30,872 -- 00:14:33,792
- Dagobah system. Dagobah.
- Whew!

146
00:14:33,875 -- 00:14:35,627
This may smell bad, kid...

147
00:14:36,461 -- 00:14:38,463
Yoda.

148
00:14:38,880 -- 00:14:40,632
...but it'll keep you warm...

149
00:14:40,966 -- 00:14:43,135
till I get the shelter up.

150
00:14:43,218 -- 00:14:45,512
Ben... Dagobah...

151
00:14:45,596 -- 00:14:47,306
Ahhh!

152
00:14:47,848 -- 00:14:52,603
Ah! I thought they smelled bad
on the outside!

153
00:15:36,271 -- 00:15:39,274
Echo Base, I've got something.

154
00:15:39,358 -- 00:15:40,859
Not much, but it could be a life form.

155
00:15:45,322 -- 00:15:47,532
Commander Skywalker, do you copy?

156
00:15:47,783 -- 00:15:49,451
This is Rogue Two.

157
00:15:49,826 -- 00:15:51,995
This is Rogue Two.

158
00:15:52,454 -- 00:15:55,582
Captain Solo, do you copy?

159
00:16:01,213 -- 00:16:04,925
Commander Skywalker, do you copy?

160
00:16:05,008 -- 00:16:06,968
This is Rogue Two.

161
00:16:07,052 -- 00:16:09,846
iGood morning.
Nice of you guys to drop by./i

162
00:16:11,014 -- 00:16:13,517
Echo Base, this is Rogue Two.

163
00:16:13,600 -- 00:16:14,893
I've found them.

164
00:16:14,976 -- 00:16:16,645
Repeat, I've found them.

165
00:16:46,967 -- 00:16:50,095
Master Luke, sir, it's so good
to see you fully functional again.

166
00:16:50,178 -- 00:16:51,388
Thanks, 3PO.

167
00:16:51,471 -- 00:16:53,181
R2 expresses his relief also.

168
00:16:53,306 -- 00:16:56,101
How ya feelin', kid?
You don't look so bad to me.

169
00:16:57,060 -- 00:16:59,855
You look strong enough
to pull the ears off a gundark.

170
00:16:59,938 -- 00:17:01,481
Thanks to you.

171
00:17:01,565 -- 00:17:04,025
That's two you owe me, junior.

172
00:17:04,317 -- 00:17:05,318
Well, Your Worship,

173
00:17:05,402 -- 00:17:08,280
looks like you managed to keep me around
for a little while longer.

174
00:17:08,780 -- 00:17:10,449
I had nothing to do with it.

175
00:17:10,574 -- 00:17:13,577
General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous
for any ships to leave the system

176
00:17:13,660 -- 00:17:14,911
until we've activated the energy field.

177
00:17:15,454 -- 00:17:16,621
That's a good story.

178
00:17:16,705 -- 00:17:18,248
I think you just can't bear to let

179
00:17:18,331 -- 00:17:20,667
a gorgeous guy like me
out of your sight.

180
00:17:21,543 -- 00:17:24,337
I don't know where
you get your delusions, laser brain.

181
00:17:27,591 -- 00:17:29,509
Laugh it up, fuzzball,

182
00:17:30,010 -- 00:17:32,888
but you didn't see us alone
in the south passage.

183
00:17:33,221 -- 00:17:35,432
She expressed her true feelings for me.

184
00:17:35,515 -- 00:17:36,767
My...

185
00:17:36,975 -- 00:17:39,936
Why, you stuck-up, half-witted,

186
00:17:40,312 -- 00:17:42,689
scruffy-looking nerf herder!

187
00:17:43,940 -- 00:17:45,650
Who's scruffy-looking?

188
00:17:49,029 -- 00:17:50,280
I must have hit
pretty close to the mark

189
00:17:50,363 -- 00:17:52,365
to get her all riled up like that,
huh, kid?

190
00:17:55,994 -- 00:17:58,663
Well, I guess you don't know
everything about women yet.

191
00:18:05,003 -- 00:18:07,798
iHeadquarters personnel,
report to command centre./i

192
00:18:10,759 -- 00:18:13,929
iHeadquarters personnel,
report to command centre./i

193
00:18:14,012 -- 00:18:15,013
Take it easy.

194
00:18:15,764 -- 00:18:17,015
Excuse us, please.

195
00:18:20,519 -- 00:18:22,604
Princess, we have a visitor.

196
00:18:23,605 -- 00:18:26,399
Picked up something
outside the base's Zone 12 moving east.

197
00:18:26,483 -- 00:18:27,484
It's metal.

198
00:18:27,567 -- 00:18:28,819
Then it couldn't be
one of those creatures.

199
00:18:28,902 -- 00:18:30,487
Could be a speeder, one of ours.

200
00:18:30,570 -- 00:18:31,780
No.

201
00:18:31,863 -- 00:18:32,906
Wait.

202
00:18:32,989 -- 00:18:35,700
There's something
very weak coming through.

203
00:18:38,954 -- 00:18:42,040
Sir, I'm fluent in six million
forms of communication.

204
00:18:42,123 -- 00:18:43,708
This signal is not used by the Alliance.

205
00:18:43,792 -- 00:18:45,293
It could be an Imperial code.

206
00:18:50,841 -- 00:18:52,092
It isn't friendly, whatever it is.

207
00:18:52,175 -- 00:18:53,593
Come on, Chewie, let's check it out.

208
00:18:53,677 -- 00:18:55,929
Send Rogues 10 and 11 to Station 38.

209
00:19:32,716 -- 00:19:33,842
iI'm afraid there's not much left./i

210
00:19:33,925 -- 00:19:35,594
- What was it?
i- Droid of some kind./i

211
00:19:35,677 -- 00:19:37,971
iI didn't hit it that hard.
Must've had a self-destruct./i

212
00:19:38,471 -- 00:19:40,056
An Imperial probe droid.

213
00:19:40,265 -- 00:19:43,018
iIt's a good bet the Empire knows
we're here./i

214
00:19:43,310 -- 00:19:45,186
We'd better start the evacuation.

215
00:20:30,315 -- 00:20:31,691
Admiral.

216
00:20:31,942 -- 00:20:33,068
Yes, Captain?

217
00:20:34,402 -- 00:20:35,570
I think we've got something, sir.

218
00:20:36,279 -- 00:20:39,240
The report is only a fragment
from a probe droid in the Hoth system,

219
00:20:39,324 -- 00:20:40,700
but it's the best lead we've had.

220
00:20:40,784 -- 00:20:43,787
We have thousands of probe droids
searching the galaxy.

221
00:20:43,870 -- 00:20:44,955
I want proof, not leads.

222
00:20:45,038 -- 00:20:46,915
The visuals indicate life readings.

223
00:20:46,998 -- 00:20:49,250
It could mean anything.
If we followed up every lead...

224
00:20:49,334 -- 00:20:52,170
But, sir, the Hoth system
is supposed to be devoid of humans.

225
00:20:52,253 -- 00:20:53,630
You've found something?

226
00:20:53,713 -- 00:20:54,839
Yes, my lord.

227
00:20:57,217 -- 00:20:59,636
That's it. The Rebels are there.

228
00:21:00,303 -- 00:21:04,265
My lord, there are so many
uncharted settlements.

229
00:21:04,349 -- 00:21:05,350
It could be smugglers...

230
00:21:05,433 -- 00:21:06,977
That is the system.

231
00:21:07,060 -- 00:21:09,604
And I'm sure Skywalker is with them.

232
00:21:09,854 -- 00:21:12,232
Set your course for the Hoth system.

233
00:21:12,440 -- 00:21:14,609
General Veers, prepare your men.

234
00:21:15,193 -- 00:21:16,444
Admiral.

235
00:21:23,201 -- 00:21:25,745
Groups 7 and 10 will stay behind
to fly the speeders.

236
00:21:25,829 -- 00:21:27,288
As soon as each transport is loaded,

237
00:21:27,372 -- 00:21:29,624
evacuation control will give clearance
for immediate launch.

238
00:21:29,708 -- 00:21:30,709
Right, sir.

239
00:21:33,795 -- 00:21:35,880
All right! That's it.

240
00:21:35,964 -- 00:21:37,007
Try it.

241
00:21:38,842 -- 00:21:41,928
Oh! Turn it off! Turn it off!

242
00:21:42,012 -- 00:21:44,139
Turn it off!

243
00:21:44,681 -- 00:21:47,934
Sir, it will take quite a while
to evacuate the T-47s.

244
00:21:48,018 -- 00:21:49,019
Forget the heavy equipment.

245
00:21:49,102 -- 00:21:51,396
There's plenty of time to get
the smaller modules on the transports.

246
00:21:51,479 -- 00:21:52,480
Take care, sir.

247
00:21:52,564 -- 00:21:53,565
Thanks.

248
00:21:56,943 -- 00:21:59,821
Chewie, take care of yourself, okay?

249
00:22:03,825 -- 00:22:05,744
Okay, okay!

250
00:22:06,911 -- 00:22:08,455
Hi, kid.

251
00:22:08,621 -- 00:22:11,041
There's got to be a reason for it.
Check it at the other end.

252
00:22:11,332 -- 00:22:12,709
Wait a second.

253
00:22:13,793 -- 00:22:15,086
You all right?

254
00:22:15,170 -- 00:22:16,421
Yeah.

255
00:22:22,927 -- 00:22:24,137
Be careful.

256
00:22:24,888 -- 00:22:26,097
You, too.

257
00:22:32,979 -- 00:22:35,023
General, there's a fleet
of Star Destroyers

258
00:22:35,106 -- 00:22:36,775
coming out of hyperspace in Sector Four.

259
00:22:37,317 -- 00:22:39,903
Reroute all power to the energy shield.

260
00:22:40,236 -- 00:22:43,490
We gotta hold them
till all transports are away.

261
00:22:43,615 -- 00:22:44,991
Prepare for ground assault.

262
00:22:59,464 -- 00:23:01,299
What is it, General?

263
00:23:01,382 -- 00:23:03,134
My lord, the fleet
has moved out of light speed.

264
00:23:03,218 -- 00:23:05,261
ComScan has detected
an energy field

265
00:23:05,345 -- 00:23:07,972
protecting an area of the sixth planet
of the Hoth system.

266
00:23:08,056 -- 00:23:10,475
The field is strong enough
to deflect any bombardment.

267
00:23:10,558 -- 00:23:13,144
The Rebels are alerted to our presence.

268
00:23:13,228 -- 00:23:16,397
Admiral Ozzel came out of light speed
too close to the system.

269
00:23:16,481 -- 00:23:18,650
He... He felt surprise was wiser.

270
00:23:18,733 -- 00:23:21,069
He is as clumsy as he is stupid.

271
00:23:21,152 -- 00:23:24,405
General, prepare your troops
for a surface attack.

272
00:23:24,489 -- 00:23:26,074
Yes, my lord.

273
00:23:33,289 -- 00:23:34,582
iLord Vader./i

274
00:23:34,666 -- 00:23:36,835
iThe fleet has moved out of light speed,
and we're preparing to.../i

275
00:23:38,670 -- 00:23:42,257
You have failed me
for the last time, Admiral.

276
00:23:42,674 -- 00:23:43,842
Captain Piett.

277
00:23:44,008 -- 00:23:45,510
iYes, my lord?/i

278
00:23:45,593 -- 00:23:48,596
Make ready to land our troops
beyond their energy field

279
00:23:48,680 -- 00:23:51,683
and deploy the fleet
so that nothing gets off the system.

280
00:23:51,766 -- 00:23:54,936
You are in command now, Admiral Piett.

281
00:23:55,019 -- 00:23:56,354
iThank you, Lord Vader./i

282
00:23:58,106 -- 00:24:01,359
All troop carriers will assemble
at the north entrance.

283
00:24:01,442 -- 00:24:04,279
The heavy transport ships
will leave as soon as they're loaded.

284
00:24:04,362 -- 00:24:06,447
Only two fighter escorts per ship.

285
00:24:06,531 -- 00:24:09,325
The energy shield
can only be opened for a short time,

286
00:24:09,409 -- 00:24:11,953
so you'll have to stay very close
to your transports.

287
00:24:12,036 -- 00:24:14,372
Two fighters against a Star Destroyer?

288
00:24:14,455 -- 00:24:16,457
The ion cannon
will fire several shots

289
00:24:16,541 -- 00:24:19,544
to make sure that any enemy ships
will be out of your flight path.

290
00:24:19,961 -- 00:24:22,046
When you've gotten past
the energy shield,

291
00:24:22,130 -- 00:24:24,215
proceed directly
to the rendezvous point.

292
00:24:24,299 -- 00:24:25,967
- Understood?
- Yeah.

293
00:24:26,050 -- 00:24:27,385
Good luck.

294
00:24:27,468 -- 00:24:29,387
Okay. Everybody to your stations.

295
00:24:29,470 -- 00:24:30,555
Let's go.

296
00:24:47,864 -- 00:24:51,159
Their primary target will be
the power generators.

297
00:24:51,367 -- 00:24:52,619
Prepare to open shield.

298
00:24:58,791 -- 00:25:00,960
Sir, Rebel ships
are coming into our sector.

299
00:25:01,044 -- 00:25:03,129
Good. Our first catch of the day.

300
00:25:04,964 -- 00:25:06,966
Stand by, ion control.

301
00:25:08,259 -- 00:25:09,260
Fire.

302
00:25:24,442 -- 00:25:27,487
iThe first transport is away./i

303
00:25:27,570 -- 00:25:31,157
iThe first transport is away./i

304
00:25:36,537 -- 00:25:38,414
Feeling all right, sir?

305
00:25:38,790 -- 00:25:40,500
Just like new, Dak. How about you?

306
00:25:40,708 -- 00:25:43,753
Right now I feel I could take on
the whole Empire myself.

307
00:25:43,836 -- 00:25:46,005
I know what you mean.

308
00:26:04,357 -- 00:26:05,483
Echo Station Three-T-Eight.

309
00:26:05,733 -- 00:26:07,360
iWe've spotted Imperial walkers./i

310
00:26:07,443 -- 00:26:09,862
iImperial walkers on the north ridge./i

311
00:26:32,343 -- 00:26:34,637
Echo Station Five-Seven.
We're on our way.

312
00:26:40,143 -- 00:26:42,145
All right, boys, keep tight now.

313
00:26:42,228 -- 00:26:44,355
Luke, I have no approach vector.
I'm not set.

314
00:26:44,439 -- 00:26:46,024
Steady, Dak.

315
00:26:46,107 -- 00:26:47,984
Attack pattern Delta. Go now.

316
00:26:51,487 -- 00:26:53,239
All right. I'm coming in.

317
00:26:57,952 -- 00:26:59,287
Hobbie, you still with me?

318
00:27:21,851 -- 00:27:23,853
That armour's too strong for blasters.

319
00:27:26,230 -- 00:27:28,399
Rogue Group,
use your harpoons and tow cables.

320
00:27:28,483 -- 00:27:30,651
Go for the legs. It might be
our only chance of stopping them.

321
00:27:32,862 -- 00:27:34,322
All right. Stand by, Dak.

322
00:27:34,405 -- 00:27:37,283
Oh, Luke,
we've got a malfunction in fire control.

323
00:27:37,367 -- 00:27:39,327
I'll have to cut in the auxiliary.

324
00:27:39,410 -- 00:27:42,121
Just hang on. Hang on, Dak.

325
00:27:42,205 -- 00:27:44,332
Get ready to fire that tow cable.

326
00:27:46,542 -- 00:27:47,543
Ah!

327
00:27:49,629 -- 00:27:50,630
Dak?

328
00:27:50,713 -- 00:27:51,714
Dak!

329
00:28:14,946 -- 00:28:17,657
Yes, Lord Vader,
I've reached the main power generators.

330
00:28:17,740 -- 00:28:19,325
The shield will be down in moments.

331
00:28:19,409 -- 00:28:20,827
You may start your landing.

332
00:28:25,998 -- 00:28:27,166
Rogue Three.

333
00:28:27,250 -- 00:28:28,376
Copy, Rogue Leader.

334
00:28:28,459 -- 00:28:30,378
iWedge, I've lost my gunner./i

335
00:28:30,461 -- 00:28:31,671
iYou'll have to make this shot./i

336
00:28:32,171 -- 00:28:33,548
iI'll cover for you./i

337
00:28:33,631 -- 00:28:35,925
Set your harpoon.
Follow me on the next pass.

338
00:28:37,301 -- 00:28:39,303
Coming around, Rogue Leader.

339
00:28:42,140 -- 00:28:44,434
Steady, Rogue Two.

340
00:28:44,517 -- 00:28:45,601
Activate harpoon.

341
00:28:48,563 -- 00:28:50,231
Good shot, Janson.

342
00:28:56,195 -- 00:28:58,489
- One more pass.
- Coming around, once more.

343
00:29:04,120 -- 00:29:06,330
Cable out. Let her go!

344
00:29:06,414 -- 00:29:08,291
Detach cable.

345
00:29:08,374 -- 00:29:09,500
Cable detached.

346
00:29:17,508 -- 00:29:19,260
Come on.

347
00:29:26,142 -- 00:29:27,518
Hah! That got him!

348
00:29:27,768 -- 00:29:29,145
I see it, Wedge. Good work.

349
00:29:29,645 -- 00:29:32,064
I don't think we can protect
two transports at a time.

350
00:29:32,148 -- 00:29:34,400
It's risky,
but we can't hold out much longer.

351
00:29:34,484 -- 00:29:36,736
We have no choice.

352
00:29:36,819 -- 00:29:37,820
Launch patrol.

353
00:29:37,904 -- 00:29:39,530
Evacuate remaining ground staff.

354
00:29:39,947 -- 00:29:41,449
Gahhh!

355
00:29:41,532 -- 00:29:44,076
No, no! No.

356
00:29:44,160 -- 00:29:46,078
This one goes there.

357
00:29:46,162 -- 00:29:48,289
That one goes there, right?

358
00:29:48,372 -- 00:29:51,918
R2, you take good care
of Master Luke now, understand?

359
00:29:53,419 -- 00:29:55,671
And do take good care of yourself.

360
00:29:59,675 -- 00:30:01,219
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

361
00:30:24,909 -- 00:30:27,119
All troops will debark
for ground assault.

362
00:30:27,203 -- 00:30:29,372
Prepare to target the main generator.

363
00:30:33,376 -- 00:30:34,377
Rogue Two, are you all right?

364
00:30:34,460 -- 00:30:36,796
Yeah. I'm with you, Rogue Leader.

365
00:30:36,879 -- 00:30:38,839
Well, set harpoon. I'll cover for you.

366
00:30:40,633 -- 00:30:41,717
Coming around.

367
00:30:41,801 -- 00:30:44,637
Watch that cross fire, boys.

368
00:30:44,720 -- 00:30:46,597
Set for position three.

369
00:30:46,847 -- 00:30:48,140
Steady.

370
00:30:48,224 -- 00:30:49,433
Stay tight and low.

371
00:30:49,517 -- 00:30:50,643
This is it!

372
00:30:50,726 -- 00:30:52,144
Aah!

373
00:30:56,232 -- 00:30:57,733
Hobbie!

374
00:30:57,817 -- 00:30:59,443
I've been hit!

375
00:31:41,694 -- 00:31:42,862
You all right?

376
00:31:43,279 -- 00:31:44,864
Why are you still here?

377
00:31:44,947 -- 00:31:46,532
Heard the command centre
had been hit.

378
00:31:46,616 -- 00:31:47,867
You've got your clearance to leave.

379
00:31:47,950 -- 00:31:49,827
Don't worry. I'll leave.

380
00:31:49,910 -- 00:31:51,662
First I'm gonna get you to your ship.

381
00:31:51,746 -- 00:31:53,372
Your Highness,
we must take this last transport.

382
00:31:53,456 -- 00:31:54,457
It's our only hope.

383
00:31:54,540 -- 00:31:57,835
Send all troops in Sector 12 to the
south slope to protect the fighters.

384
00:31:57,918 -- 00:31:59,128
Ah!

385
00:31:59,545 -- 00:32:01,505
iImperial troops have entered the base./i

386
00:32:01,589 -- 00:32:02,882
iImperial troops have entered.../i

387
00:32:02,965 -- 00:32:04,592
Come on. That's it.

388
00:32:05,259 -- 00:32:07,219
Give the evacuation code signal.

389
00:32:09,680 -- 00:32:10,973
And get to your transports!

390
00:32:11,223 -- 00:32:12,975
Oh! Wait for me!

391
00:32:13,225 -- 00:32:16,646
Begin retreat! Fall back!

392
00:33:15,579 -- 00:33:16,956
Distance to power generators?

393
00:33:17,039 -- 00:33:18,332
i17.28./i

394
00:33:27,758 -- 00:33:29,719
Target. Maximum firepower.

395
00:33:55,828 -- 00:33:58,706
Transport, this is Solo.
Better take off. I can't get to you.

396
00:33:58,789 -- 00:34:00,666
I'll get her out on the iFalcon./i
Come on.

397
00:34:01,917 -- 00:34:04,003
B-B-But where are you going?

398
00:34:04,086 -- 00:34:05,212
Come back!

399
00:34:23,022 -- 00:34:24,023
Wait!

400
00:34:24,106 -- 00:34:26,692
Wait for me! Wait! Stop!

401
00:34:27,401 -- 00:34:29,028
- How typical.
- Come on.

402
00:34:32,740 -- 00:34:33,908
Hurry up, goldenrod.

403
00:34:33,991 -- 00:34:35,659
You're gonna be a permanent resident.

404
00:34:35,743 -- 00:34:37,077
Wait! Wait!

405
00:34:55,763 -- 00:34:56,764
How's this?

406
00:34:57,264 -- 00:34:58,891
Would it help if I got out and pushed?

407
00:34:58,974 -- 00:35:00,142
Captain Solo! Captain Solo!

408
00:35:00,226 -- 00:35:01,227
It might.

409
00:35:02,603 -- 00:35:05,147
Sir, might I suggest that you...

410
00:35:06,023 -- 00:35:07,066
It can wait.

411
00:35:11,153 -- 00:35:13,572
This bucket of bolts is never gonna
get us past that blockade.

412
00:35:13,656 -- 00:35:15,991
This baby's got a few surprises
left in her, sweetheart.

413
00:35:24,959 -- 00:35:26,544
Come on! Come on!

414
00:35:26,627 -- 00:35:29,171
Switch over.
Let's hope we don't have a burnout.

415
00:35:31,924 -- 00:35:32,925
See?

416
00:35:33,008 -- 00:35:35,427
Someday you're gonna be wrong,
and I just hope I'm there to see it.

417
00:35:37,972 -- 00:35:39,139
Punch it!

418
00:35:56,949 -- 00:35:58,367
R2!

419
00:35:58,450 -- 00:36:00,911
Get her ready for take-off.

420
00:36:03,747 -- 00:36:06,500
Good luck, Luke.
See you at the rendezvous.

421
00:36:09,420 -- 00:36:12,047
Don't worry, R2.
We're going. We're going.

422
00:36:24,560 -- 00:36:25,895
There's nothing wrong, R2.

423
00:36:26,478 -- 00:36:28,022
I'm just setting a new course.

424
00:36:31,233 -- 00:36:32,860
We're not gonna regroup with the others.

425
00:36:34,028 -- 00:36:35,738
We're going to the Dagobah system.

426
00:36:37,740 -- 00:36:39,491
Yes, R2?

427
00:36:42,036 -- 00:36:43,078
That's all right.

428
00:36:43,162 -- 00:36:45,205
I'd like to keep it
on manual control for a while.

429
00:37:02,097 -- 00:37:03,265
I saw 'em! I saw 'em!

430
00:37:03,515 -- 00:37:04,600
Saw what?

431
00:37:04,683 -- 00:37:06,852
Star Destroyers,
two of 'em coming right at us.

432
00:37:06,936 -- 00:37:08,479
Sir! Sir! Might I suggest...

433
00:37:08,562 -- 00:37:09,980
Shut him up or shut him down!

434
00:37:11,607 -- 00:37:13,567
Check the deflector shield.

435
00:37:14,526 -- 00:37:15,569
Great.

436
00:37:15,653 -- 00:37:17,446
Well, we can still outmanoeuvre them.

437
00:37:21,951 -- 00:37:23,869
Take evasive action!

438
00:37:35,589 -- 00:37:37,216
Prepare to make the jump
to light speed.

439
00:37:37,299 -- 00:37:38,300
But, sir!

440
00:37:38,759 -- 00:37:40,386
They're getting closer.

441
00:37:40,970 -- 00:37:43,097
Oh, yeah? Watch this.

442
00:37:46,308 -- 00:37:47,643
Watch what?

443
00:37:49,645 -- 00:37:50,688
I think we're in trouble.

444
00:37:50,771 -- 00:37:52,564
If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier

445
00:37:52,648 -- 00:37:54,316
the hyperdrive motivator
has been damaged.

446
00:37:54,566 -- 00:37:56,193
It's impossible to go to light speed.

447
00:37:56,276 -- 00:37:57,403
We're in trouble.

448
00:38:02,116 -- 00:38:03,325
Horizontal boosters!

449
00:38:03,617 -- 00:38:05,577
Gahhh!

450
00:38:05,661 -- 00:38:07,705
Alluvial dampers.

451
00:38:08,831 -- 00:38:11,000
Ow! That's not it.

452
00:38:11,083 -- 00:38:12,543
Bring me the hydrospanner!

453
00:38:16,255 -- 00:38:18,340
I don't know how
we're gonna get out of this one.

454
00:38:20,843 -- 00:38:22,011
Ow!

455
00:38:22,094 -- 00:38:23,178
Chewie!

456
00:38:27,349 -- 00:38:28,934
That wasn't a laser blast.
Something hit us.

457
00:38:29,018 -- 00:38:30,644
Han, get up here!

458
00:38:32,146 -- 00:38:33,355
Come on, Chewie!

459
00:38:34,314 -- 00:38:35,607
Asteroids.

460
00:38:35,983 -- 00:38:37,151
Oh, no.

461
00:38:39,069 -- 00:38:40,612
Chewie, set two-seven-one.

462
00:38:41,030 -- 00:38:42,031
What are you doing?

463
00:38:43,157 -- 00:38:45,784
You're not actually going
into an asteroid field?

464
00:38:45,868 -- 00:38:47,703
They'd be crazy to follow us,
wouldn't they?

465
00:38:51,123 -- 00:38:52,791
You don't have to do this to impress me.

466
00:38:52,875 -- 00:38:55,127
Sir, the possibility
of successfully navigating

467
00:38:55,210 -- 00:38:57,713
an asteroid field
is approximately 3,720 to 1.

468
00:38:57,796 -- 00:38:59,381
Never tell me the odds!

469
00:39:21,737 -- 00:39:24,073
Look out!

470
00:39:27,242 -- 00:39:29,328
You said you wanted
to be around when I made a mistake.

471
00:39:29,411 -- 00:39:32,247
- This could be it, sweetheart.
- I take it back.

472
00:39:32,331 -- 00:39:35,334
We're going to get pulverised
if we stay out here much longer.

473
00:39:35,417 -- 00:39:37,878
- Ain't gonna argue with that.
- Pulverised?

474
00:39:37,961 -- 00:39:39,338
I'm going in closer
to one of the big ones.

475
00:39:39,463 -- 00:39:41,048
- Closer?
- Closer?

476
00:39:41,131 -- 00:39:42,174
Gahhh!

477
00:40:08,367 -- 00:40:10,285
Oh, this is suicide!
There's nowhere to go.

478
00:40:10,369 -- 00:40:12,371
There. That looks pretty good.

479
00:40:12,663 -- 00:40:14,123
What looks pretty good?

480
00:40:14,206 -- 00:40:16,291
Yeah, that'll do nicely.

481
00:40:16,750 -- 00:40:19,128
Excuse me, ma'am,
but where are we going?

482
00:40:29,888 -- 00:40:32,224
I hope you know what you're doing.

483
00:40:32,307 -- 00:40:33,642
Yeah. Me, too.

484
00:40:42,234 -- 00:40:44,736
Yep, that's it. Dagobah.

485
00:40:47,114 -- 00:40:49,283
No, I'm not gonna change my mind
about this.

486
00:40:50,075 -- 00:40:52,828
I'm not picking up
any cities or technology.

487
00:40:52,911 -- 00:40:55,372
Massive life form readings, though.

488
00:40:56,331 -- 00:40:58,083
There's something alive down there.

489
00:40:59,793 -- 00:41:02,379
Yes. I'm sure
it's perfectly safe for droids.

490
00:41:09,845 -- 00:41:11,138
I know! I know!

491
00:41:11,805 -- 00:41:13,849
All the scopes are dead.
I can't see a thing.

492
00:41:14,892 -- 00:41:16,101
Just hang on.

493
00:41:16,185 -- 00:41:18,061
I'm gonna start the landing cycle.

494
00:42:11,907 -- 00:42:14,451
No, R2, you stay put.
I'll have a look around.

495
00:42:19,248 -- 00:42:20,374
R2?

496
00:42:21,083 -- 00:42:22,084
R2!

497
00:42:24,419 -- 00:42:25,545
Where are you?

498
00:42:28,882 -- 00:42:30,300
R2!

499
00:42:37,432 -- 00:42:39,059
You be more careful.

500
00:42:42,020 -- 00:42:44,856
R2, that way.

501
00:43:12,718 -- 00:43:14,011
R2!

502
00:43:41,580 -- 00:43:42,831
Oh, no.

503
00:43:44,166 -- 00:43:45,250
Are you all right?

504
00:43:45,334 -- 00:43:47,669
Come on.

505
00:43:49,921 -- 00:43:52,257
You were lucky to get out of there.

506
00:43:53,175 -- 00:43:54,301
Anything broken?

507
00:43:58,055 -- 00:44:00,599
If you're saying coming here
was a bad idea,

508
00:44:00,682 -- 00:44:02,225
I'm beginning to agree with you.

509
00:44:03,393 -- 00:44:05,479
R2, what are we doing here?

510
00:44:06,063 -- 00:44:10,776
It's like...
something out of a dream or...

511
00:44:11,526 -- 00:44:13,153
I don't know.

512
00:44:13,528 -- 00:44:15,572
Maybe I'm just going crazy.

513
00:44:48,188 -- 00:44:49,272
Yes, Admiral?

514
00:44:49,815 -- 00:44:52,067
Our ships have sighted
the iMillennium Falcon,/i lord,

515
00:44:52,150 -- 00:44:54,820
but it has entered an asteroid field,
and we cannot risk...

516
00:44:54,903 -- 00:44:57,364
Asteroids do not concern me, Admiral.

517
00:44:57,781 -- 00:45:00,659
I want that ship, not excuses.

518
00:45:01,034 -- 00:45:02,285
Yes, lord.

519
00:45:07,707 -- 00:45:10,752
I'm gonna shut down everything
but the emergency power systems.

520
00:45:10,836 -- 00:45:12,671
Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask,

521
00:45:12,754 -- 00:45:14,840
but does that include
shutting me down, too?

522
00:45:14,923 -- 00:45:17,175
No. I need you to talk to the iFalcon./i

523
00:45:17,259 -- 00:45:19,094
Find out what's wrong
with the hyperdrive.

524
00:45:27,269 -- 00:45:30,564
Sir, it's quite possible
this asteroid is not entirely stable.

525
00:45:30,939 -- 00:45:32,732
Not entirely stable?

526
00:45:32,816 -- 00:45:34,776
I'm glad you're here
to tell us these things.

527
00:45:35,026 -- 00:45:38,363
Chewie, take the professor in the back
and plug him into the hyperdrive.

528
00:45:38,780 -- 00:45:41,366
Sometimes I just don't understand
human behaviour.

529
00:45:41,450 -- 00:45:43,785
After all, I'm only trying to do my job.

530
00:45:48,623 -- 00:45:50,125
- Let go.
- Shh!

531
00:45:51,793 -- 00:45:53,211
Let go, please.

532
00:45:53,295 -- 00:45:54,546
Don't get excited.

533
00:45:54,629 -- 00:45:57,757
Captain, being held by you
isn't quite enough to get me excited.

534
00:45:58,508 -- 00:46:00,051
Sorry, sweetheart.

535
00:46:00,135 -- 00:46:02,095
I haven't got time for anything else.

536
00:46:37,130 -- 00:46:38,131
What?

537
00:46:38,215 -- 00:46:40,050
Ready for some power?

538
00:46:40,133 -- 00:46:41,176
Okay.

539
00:46:44,387 -- 00:46:45,722
Let's see now.

540
00:46:45,805 -- 00:46:47,599
Put that in there.

541
00:46:48,016 -- 00:46:49,184
There you go.

542
00:46:51,895 -- 00:46:53,772
Now all I gotta do is find this Yoda...

543
00:46:54,564 -- 00:46:56,149
if he even exists.

544
00:47:02,405 -- 00:47:05,492
It's really a strange place
to find a Jedi master.

545
00:47:07,035 -- 00:47:08,912
This place gives me the creeps.

546
00:47:12,541 -- 00:47:13,833
Still...

547
00:47:15,669 -- 00:47:17,546
there's something familiar
about this place.

548
00:47:19,714 -- 00:47:21,258
I don't know.

549
00:47:21,341 -- 00:47:22,425
I feel like...

550
00:47:22,509 -- 00:47:23,927
Feel like what?

551
00:47:24,761 -- 00:47:26,471
Like we're being watched!

552
00:47:26,555 -- 00:47:29,474
Away put your weapon!
I mean you no harm.

553
00:47:30,559 -- 00:47:33,520
I am wondering... why are you here?

554
00:47:34,688 -- 00:47:36,606
I'm looking for someone.

555
00:47:36,690 -- 00:47:38,149
Looking?

556
00:47:38,233 -- 00:47:41,611
Found someone you have,
I would say, hmm?

557
00:47:41,903 -- 00:47:43,697
Right.

558
00:47:44,406 -- 00:47:47,158
Help you I can. Yes, mmm.

559
00:47:47,826 -- 00:47:49,244
I don't think so.

560
00:47:50,036 -- 00:47:51,746
I'm looking for a great warrior.

561
00:47:51,830 -- 00:47:53,039
Ah!

562
00:47:53,582 -- 00:47:55,417
A great warrior.

563
00:47:57,919 -- 00:47:59,838
Wars not make one great.

564
00:48:08,930 -- 00:48:10,181
Put that down.

565
00:48:10,265 -- 00:48:12,767
Hey! That's my dinner!

566
00:48:15,437 -- 00:48:18,690
How you get so big
eating food of this kind?

567
00:48:18,773 -- 00:48:20,859
Listen, friend, we didn't mean
to land in that puddle.

568
00:48:20,942 -- 00:48:22,694
And if we could get our ship out,
we would.

569
00:48:22,777 -- 00:48:23,820
But we can't, so why don't you...

570
00:48:23,903 -- 00:48:25,822
Cannot get your ship out. Hee hee hee!

571
00:48:25,905 -- 00:48:27,365
Hey, get out of there!

572
00:48:27,449 -- 00:48:28,700
Ah!

573
00:48:28,783 -- 00:48:30,827
No! Ooh!

574
00:48:30,910 -- 00:48:32,621
Hey, you could have broken this.

575
00:48:34,497 -- 00:48:35,498
Don't do that.

576
00:48:37,292 -- 00:48:38,710
Oh!

577
00:48:45,800 -- 00:48:47,802
You're making a mess.

578
00:48:49,804 -- 00:48:51,681
Hey, give me that!

579
00:48:51,765 -- 00:48:54,392
Mine, or I will help you not.

580
00:48:54,476 -- 00:48:56,311
I don't want your help.
I want my lamp back.

581
00:48:56,394 -- 00:48:58,396
I'm gonna need it
to get out of this slimy mudhole.

582
00:48:58,480 -- 00:49:00,315
Mudhole? Slimy?

583
00:49:00,398 -- 00:49:01,733
My home this is.

584
00:49:02,150 -- 00:49:04,694
Wha...

585
00:49:05,320 -- 00:49:06,863
R2, let him have it.

586
00:49:08,990 -- 00:49:11,284
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

587
00:49:11,368 -- 00:49:12,452
R2!

588
00:49:15,789 -- 00:49:17,207
Now, will you move along, little fellow?

589
00:49:17,290 -- 00:49:18,750
We've got a lot of work to do.

590
00:49:18,833 -- 00:49:20,418
No! No, no!

591
00:49:20,502 -- 00:49:23,880
Stay and help you I will...
find your friend.

592
00:49:24,464 -- 00:49:27,676
I'm not looking for a friend.
I'm looking for a Jedi master.

593
00:49:28,051 -- 00:49:31,930
Oh. Jedi master. Yoda.

594
00:49:32,013 -- 00:49:33,640
You seek Yoda.

595
00:49:33,723 -- 00:49:34,849
You know him?

596
00:49:34,933 -- 00:49:38,436
Mmm. Take you to him I will.

597
00:49:38,520 -- 00:49:43,233
Yes, yes,
but now we must eat. Come.

598
00:49:43,942 -- 00:49:45,443
Good food. Come.

599
00:49:55,412 -- 00:49:57,288
Come, come.

600
00:49:59,082 -- 00:50:02,961
R2... stay and watch after the camp.

601
00:50:16,558 -- 00:50:19,310
Oh! Where is R2 when I need him?

602
00:50:19,394 -- 00:50:22,439
Sir, I don't know where your ship
learned to communicate,

603
00:50:22,522 -- 00:50:24,315
but it has the most peculiar dialect.

604
00:50:24,399 -- 00:50:26,067
I believe, sir, it says
that the power coupling

605
00:50:26,151 -- 00:50:27,819
on the negative axis has been polarised.

606
00:50:27,902 -- 00:50:30,447
I'm afraid you'll have to replace it.

607
00:50:31,072 -- 00:50:33,742
Well, of course I'll have to replace it.

608
00:50:34,659 -- 00:50:36,453
Here! And, Chewie...

609
00:50:38,872 -- 00:50:40,915
I think we'd better replace
the negative power coupling.

610
00:51:03,438 -- 00:51:06,608
Hey, Your Worship,
I'm only trying to help.

611
00:51:06,691 -- 00:51:08,943
Would you please stop calling me that?

612
00:51:09,027 -- 00:51:11,112
Sure, Leia.

613
00:51:11,321 -- 00:51:13,323
You make it so difficult sometimes.

614
00:51:13,406 -- 00:51:15,366
I do. I really do.

615
00:51:15,533 -- 00:51:17,994
You could be a little nicer, though.

616
00:51:18,077 -- 00:51:20,997
Come on, admit it.
Sometimes you think I'm all right.

617
00:51:22,916 -- 00:51:25,418
Occasionally... maybe...

618
00:51:25,502 -- 00:51:27,962
when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.

619
00:51:28,046 -- 00:51:29,881
Scoundrel?

620
00:51:29,964 -- 00:51:31,591
Scoundrel?

621
00:51:33,718 -- 00:51:35,386
I like the sound of that.

622
00:51:36,387 -- 00:51:37,388
Stop that.

623
00:51:37,680 -- 00:51:39,057
Stop what?

624
00:51:39,140 -- 00:51:41,392
Stop that. My hands are dirty.

625
00:51:41,476 -- 00:51:43,853
My hands are dirty, too.
What are you afraid of?

626
00:51:43,937 -- 00:51:45,063
Afraid?

627
00:51:45,146 -- 00:51:46,856
You're trembling.

628
00:51:46,940 -- 00:51:48,650
I'm not trembling.

629
00:51:49,984 -- 00:51:52,320
You like me because I'm a scoundrel.

630
00:51:53,154 -- 00:51:55,406
There aren't enough scoundrels
in your life.

631
00:51:55,490 -- 00:51:57,242
I happen to like nice men.

632
00:51:57,909 -- 00:51:58,910
I'm a nice man.

633
00:51:59,118 -- 00:52:00,453
No, you're not. You're...

634
00:52:03,498 -- 00:52:07,168
Sir, sir! I've isolated
the reverse power flux coupling.

635
00:52:09,546 -- 00:52:10,755
Thank you.

636
00:52:10,839 -- 00:52:12,090
Thank you very much.

637
00:52:12,173 -- 00:52:14,008
Oh, you're perfectly welcome, sir.

638
00:52:20,056 -- 00:52:23,434
iAnd that, Lord Vader, was the last time
they appeared in any of our scopes./i

639
00:52:23,518 -- 00:52:24,936
iConsidering the amount of damage
we've sustained,/i

640
00:52:25,019 -- 00:52:26,437
ithey must have been destroyed./i

641
00:52:26,521 -- 00:52:29,023
No, Captain. They're alive.

642
00:52:29,607 -- 00:52:34,195
I want every ship available to sweep
the asteroid field until they are found.

643
00:52:38,116 -- 00:52:39,576
Lord Vader.

644
00:52:40,368 -- 00:52:41,578
Yes, Admiral. What is it?

645
00:52:42,161 -- 00:52:44,080
The Emperor commands you
to make contact with him.

646
00:52:44,163 -- 00:52:46,666
Move the ship out of the asteroid field

647
00:52:46,749 -- 00:52:49,002
so that we can send
a clear transmission.

648
00:52:49,168 -- 00:52:50,587
Yes, my lord.

649
00:53:07,520 -- 00:53:09,981
What is thy bidding, my master?

650
00:53:11,024 -- 00:53:15,278
iThere is a great disturbance
in the Force./i

651
00:53:16,154 -- 00:53:17,697
I have felt it.

652
00:53:18,573 -- 00:53:21,034
iWe have a new enemy,/i

653
00:53:21,242 -- 00:53:25,246
ithe young Rebel
who destroyed the Death Star./i

654
00:53:25,955 -- 00:53:32,921
iI have no doubt this boy
is the offspring of Anakin Skywalker./i

655
00:53:33,129 -- 00:53:35,506
How is that possible?

656
00:53:35,590 -- 00:53:39,010
iSearch your feelings, Lord Vader./i

657
00:53:39,093 -- 00:53:41,721
iYou will know it to be true./i

658
00:53:42,513 -- 00:53:44,891
iHe could destroy us./i

659
00:53:44,974 -- 00:53:47,101
He's just a boy.

660
00:53:47,185 -- 00:53:49,729
Obi-Wan can no longer help him.

661
00:53:50,021 -- 00:53:53,775
iThe Force is strong with him./i

662
00:53:54,609 -- 00:53:59,572
iThe son of Skywalker
must not become a Jedi./i

663
00:53:59,948 -- 00:54:01,991
If he could be turned,

664
00:54:02,075 -- 00:54:04,953
he would become a powerful ally.

665
00:54:05,870 -- 00:54:07,956
iYes./i

666
00:54:08,581 -- 00:54:12,126
iHe would be a great asset./i

667
00:54:12,961 -- 00:54:15,213
iCan it be done?/i

668
00:54:15,296 -- 00:54:18,675
He will join us or die, master.

669
00:54:35,942 -- 00:54:37,193
Look, I'm sure it's delicious.

670
00:54:37,276 -- 00:54:39,654
I just don't understand
why we can't see Yoda now.

671
00:54:39,737 -- 00:54:40,738
Patience!

672
00:54:40,822 -- 00:54:43,408
For the Jedi,
it is time to eat as well.

673
00:54:43,491 -- 00:54:44,909
Hmm?

674
00:54:46,786 -- 00:54:48,997
Eat, eat.

675
00:54:49,872 -- 00:54:50,957
Hot!

676
00:54:58,798 -- 00:55:00,842
Good food! Mmm, good, hmm?

677
00:55:00,925 -- 00:55:03,970
How far away is Yoda?
Will it take us long to get there?

678
00:55:04,053 -- 00:55:05,847
Not far. Yoda not far.

679
00:55:06,347 -- 00:55:08,975
Patience. Soon you will be with him.

680
00:55:11,519 -- 00:55:12,979
Root leaf.

681
00:55:13,062 -- 00:55:14,564
I cook.

682
00:55:15,982 -- 00:55:19,569
Why wish you become Jedi? Hmm? Hmm?

683
00:55:19,652 -- 00:55:21,279
Mostly because of my father, I guess.

684
00:55:21,362 -- 00:55:23,448
Ah, father.

685
00:55:23,531 -- 00:55:25,116
Powerful Jedi was he.

686
00:55:25,199 -- 00:55:28,244
Hee hee. Mmm, powerful Jedi.

687
00:55:28,327 -- 00:55:29,412
Oh, come on.

688
00:55:29,495 -- 00:55:30,621
How could you know my father?

689
00:55:30,705 -- 00:55:32,290
You don't even know who I am.

690
00:55:32,373 -- 00:55:35,209
I don't even know what I'm doing here.
We're wasting our time!

691
00:55:37,253 -- 00:55:39,130
I cannot teach him.

692
00:55:39,797 -- 00:55:41,758
The boy has no patience.

693
00:55:42,008 -- 00:55:44,302
iHe will learn patience./i

694
00:55:44,385 -- 00:55:45,720
Hmm...

695
00:55:49,140 -- 00:55:51,726
Much anger in him,

696
00:55:52,060 -- 00:55:53,770
like his father.

697
00:55:53,853 -- 00:55:56,606
iWas I any different when you taught me?/i

698
00:55:58,816 -- 00:56:00,693
No.

699
00:56:00,860 -- 00:56:02,528
He is not ready.

700
00:56:02,612 -- 00:56:03,905
Yoda.

701
00:56:07,200 -- 00:56:08,659
I am ready.

702
00:56:08,785 -- 00:56:09,994
Ben... I can be a Jedi.

703
00:56:10,078 -- 00:56:12,038
Ben, tell him I'm...

704
00:56:12,121 -- 00:56:13,664
Ready, are you?

705
00:56:13,748 -- 00:56:15,917
What know you ready?

706
00:56:16,000 -- 00:56:19,962
For 800 years have I trained Jedi.

707
00:56:20,046 -- 00:56:23,716
My own counsel will I keep
on who is to be trained.

708
00:56:25,802 -- 00:56:29,764
A Jedi must have
the deepest commitment, hmm?

709
00:56:29,847 -- 00:56:31,766
The most serious mind.

710
00:56:33,351 -- 00:56:36,479
This one a long time have I watched.

711
00:56:37,563 -- 00:56:40,566
All his life has he looked away...

712
00:56:40,775 -- 00:56:43,861
to the future, to the horizon.

713
00:56:43,945 -- 00:56:47,365
Never his mind on where he was,

714
00:56:47,448 -- 00:56:48,699
hmm?

715
00:56:48,783 -- 00:56:50,743
What he was doing.

716
00:56:50,827 -- 00:56:52,286
Hmph!

717
00:56:52,578 -- 00:56:53,663
Adventure.

718
00:56:53,746 -- 00:56:54,747
Ha!

719
00:56:54,831 -- 00:56:56,165
Excitement. Ha!

720
00:56:56,499 -- 00:56:58,960
A Jedi craves not these things.

721
00:56:59,836 -- 00:57:01,754
You are reckless!

722
00:57:01,838 -- 00:57:04,841
iSo was I, if you remember./i

723
00:57:05,174 -- 00:57:06,592
He is too old.

724
00:57:08,052 -- 00:57:10,638
Yes, too old to begin the training.

725
00:57:11,305 -- 00:57:13,015
But I've learned so much.

726
00:57:16,644 -- 00:57:17,895
Ahh...

727
00:57:20,690 -- 00:57:22,400
Will he finish what he begins?

728
00:57:22,859 -- 00:57:24,610
I won't fail you.

729
00:57:25,820 -- 00:57:27,363
I'm not afraid.

730
00:57:28,906 -- 00:57:30,116
Oh...

731
00:57:31,826 -- 00:57:33,494
You will be.

732
00:57:35,121 -- 00:57:36,789
You will be.

733
00:58:17,955 -- 00:58:19,165
Aah!

734
00:58:19,248 -- 00:58:20,917
Sir, if I may venture an opinion...

735
00:58:21,000 -- 00:58:22,627
I'm not really interested
in your opinion, 3PO.

736
00:58:22,710 -- 00:58:23,961
There's something out there.

737
00:58:24,962 -- 00:58:25,963
Where?

738
00:58:26,047 -- 00:58:27,048
Outside in the cave.

739
00:58:28,633 -- 00:58:30,051
There it is. Listen. Listen!

740
00:58:30,134 -- 00:58:31,177
I'm going out there.

741
00:58:31,260 -- 00:58:32,261
Are you crazy?

742
00:58:32,345 -- 00:58:33,346
I just got this bucket back together.

743
00:58:33,429 -- 00:58:35,014
I'm not going to let something
tear it apart.

744
00:58:35,097 -- 00:58:36,891
Oh! Then I'm going with you.

745
00:58:37,892 -- 00:58:39,352
I think it might be better

746
00:58:39,435 -- 00:58:41,479
if I stay behind and guard the ship.

747
00:58:41,562 -- 00:58:42,563
Oh, no.

748
00:58:57,328 -- 00:58:59,872
This ground sure feels strange.

749
00:59:01,123 -- 00:59:03,042
It doesn't feel like rock.

750
00:59:06,671 -- 00:59:07,797
Hmm.

751
00:59:07,880 -- 00:59:09,674
There's an awful lot
of moisture in here.

752
00:59:10,132 -- 00:59:11,217
I don't know.

753
00:59:11,842 -- 00:59:14,345
I have a bad feeling about this.

754
00:59:14,720 -- 00:59:15,805
Yeah.

755
00:59:17,265 -- 00:59:18,266
Watch out!

756
00:59:19,517 -- 00:59:20,768
It's all right.

757
00:59:20,851 -- 00:59:21,852
It's all right.

758
00:59:21,936 -- 00:59:24,814
Yeah, that's what I thought. Mynock.

759
00:59:24,897 -- 00:59:28,150
Chewie, check the rest of the ship and
make sure there are no more attached,

760
00:59:28,234 -- 00:59:30,194
chewing on the power cables.

761
00:59:30,278 -- 00:59:31,737
Mynocks.

762
00:59:31,862 -- 00:59:34,073
Go on inside. We'll clean them off
if there are any more.

763
00:59:38,619 -- 00:59:39,620
Han!

764
00:59:42,081 -- 00:59:44,792
Aagghh! Go away, go away, beastly thing!

765
00:59:44,875 -- 00:59:45,960
Shoo! Shoo!

766
00:59:52,800 -- 00:59:54,719
Wait a minute...

767
01:00:16,449 -- 01:00:17,700
Let's get out of here!

768
01:00:17,783 -- 01:00:19,994
The Empire is still out there!
I don't think...

769
01:00:20,077 -- 01:00:21,746
No time to discuss this in committee!

770
01:00:22,580 -- 01:00:24,582
I'm not a committee!

771
01:00:30,546 -- 01:00:33,257
You can't make the jump
to light speed in this asteroid field.

772
01:00:33,341 -- 01:00:35,509
Sit down, sweetheart! We're taking off!

773
01:00:39,930 -- 01:00:40,931
Look!

774
01:00:41,015 -- 01:00:42,183
I see it. I see it.

775
01:00:42,266 -- 01:00:43,267
We're doomed!

776
01:00:43,351 -- 01:00:44,602
The cave is collapsing.

777
01:00:44,685 -- 01:00:46,687
- This is no cave.
- What?

778
01:01:19,303 -- 01:01:20,304
Run!

779
01:01:21,180 -- 01:01:25,393
Yes! A Jedi's strength
flows from the Force.

780
01:01:25,476 -- 01:01:27,269
But beware of the dark side.

781
01:01:27,353 -- 01:01:29,063
Anger, fear, aggression...

782
01:01:29,146 -- 01:01:32,233
The dark side of the Force are they,

783
01:01:32,316 -- 01:01:35,236
easily they flow,
quick to join you in a fight.

784
01:01:35,319 -- 01:01:37,613
If once you start down the dark path,

785
01:01:37,696 -- 01:01:39,740
forever will it dominate your destiny.

786
01:01:39,824 -- 01:01:41,158
Consume you it will,

787
01:01:41,242 -- 01:01:43,327
as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice.

788
01:01:43,661 -- 01:01:45,162
Vader.

789
01:01:46,038 -- 01:01:47,456
Is the dark side stronger?

790
01:01:47,540 -- 01:01:49,041
No, no.

791
01:01:49,333 -- 01:01:50,418
No.

792
01:01:50,501 -- 01:01:53,045
Quicker, easier, more seductive.

793
01:01:53,921 -- 01:01:56,006
But how am I to know
the good side from the bad?

794
01:01:56,090 -- 01:01:59,593
You will know when you are calm,

795
01:01:59,677 -- 01:02:01,262
at peace,

796
01:02:01,554 -- 01:02:03,055
passive.

797
01:02:03,139 -- 01:02:08,185
Hmm. A Jedi uses the Force
for knowledge and defence,

798
01:02:08,644 -- 01:02:10,396
never for attack.

799
01:02:10,479 -- 01:02:11,480
But tell me why I can't...

800
01:02:11,564 -- 01:02:13,607
No, no. There is no why.

801
01:02:13,941 -- 01:02:16,485
Nothing more will I teach you today.

802
01:02:17,027 -- 01:02:19,196
Clear your mind of questions.

803
01:02:20,281 -- 01:02:23,033
Hmm...

804
01:02:23,117 -- 01:02:24,618
Mmm...

805
01:02:41,760 -- 01:02:43,888
There's something not right here.

806
01:02:47,892 -- 01:02:49,477
I feel cold...

807
01:02:49,768 -- 01:02:50,853
death.

808
01:02:50,936 -- 01:02:53,022
That place...

809
01:02:53,105 -- 01:02:56,233
is strong with the dark side
of the Force.

810
01:02:56,567 -- 01:02:58,819
A domain of evil it is.

811
01:03:00,237 -- 01:03:01,989
In you must go.

812
01:03:02,781 -- 01:03:04,575
What's in there?

813
01:03:06,827 -- 01:03:08,704
Only what you take with you.

814
01:03:13,167 -- 01:03:14,418
Your weapons...

815
01:03:15,085 -- 01:03:16,962
you will not need them.

816
01:05:44,902 -- 01:05:45,903
Hmph.

817
01:05:56,622 -- 01:05:59,083
Bounty hunters.
We don't need their scum.

818
01:05:59,166 -- 01:06:00,376
Yes, sir.

819
01:06:00,459 -- 01:06:02,544
Those Rebels won't escape us.

820
01:06:08,050 -- 01:06:11,011
Sir, we have a priority signal
from the Star Destroyer iAvenger./i

821
01:06:11,095 -- 01:06:12,429
Right.

822
01:06:12,971 -- 01:06:15,265
There will be a substantial reward

823
01:06:15,349 -- 01:06:18,894
for the one who finds
the iMillennium Falcon./i

824
01:06:18,977 -- 01:06:21,980
You are free to use
any methods necessary,

825
01:06:22,189 -- 01:06:24,316
but I want them alive.

826
01:06:24,400 -- 01:06:26,735
No disintegrations.

827
01:06:26,819 -- 01:06:27,903
As you wish.

828
01:06:27,986 -- 01:06:29,363
Lord Vader.

829
01:06:30,864 -- 01:06:32,908
My lord, we have them.

830
01:06:37,538 -- 01:06:40,666
Oh, thank goodness
we're coming out of the asteroid field.

831
01:06:45,587 -- 01:06:47,715
Let's get out of here.
Ready for light speed?

832
01:06:48,257 -- 01:06:49,425
One...

833
01:06:49,508 -- 01:06:51,260
two...

834
01:06:51,343 -- 01:06:52,511
three!

835
01:06:58,058 -- 01:06:59,476
It's not fair.

836
01:06:59,560 -- 01:07:00,894
Gahhh!

837
01:07:02,896 -- 01:07:05,399
Transfer circuits aren't working.
It's not my fault!

838
01:07:05,482 -- 01:07:06,483
No light speed?

839
01:07:06,567 -- 01:07:08,485
It's not my fault.

840
01:07:13,282 -- 01:07:15,284
Sir, we've just lost
the main rear deflector shield.

841
01:07:15,367 -- 01:07:17,578
One more direct hit
on the back quarter and we're done for.

842
01:07:17,828 -- 01:07:18,912
Turn her around.

843
01:07:19,079 -- 01:07:20,372
I said, turn her around.

844
01:07:20,456 -- 01:07:21,915
I'm going to put all power
in the front shield.

845
01:07:21,999 -- 01:07:23,000
You're going to attack them?

846
01:07:23,125 -- 01:07:24,168
Sir, the odds of surviving

847
01:07:24,251 -- 01:07:26,086
a direct assault on
an Imperial Star Destroyer...

848
01:07:26,170 -- 01:07:28,130
- Shut up!
- Gaahh!

849
01:07:34,803 -- 01:07:36,805
They're moving to attack position.

850
01:07:39,183 -- 01:07:40,350
Shields up.

851
01:07:46,440 -- 01:07:48,442
Track them.
They may come around for another pass.

852
01:07:48,525 -- 01:07:50,861
Captain Needa, the ship
no longer appears on our scopes.

853
01:07:51,320 -- 01:07:52,863
They can't have disappeared.

854
01:07:53,363 -- 01:07:55,574
No ship that small
has a cloaking device.

855
01:07:55,657 -- 01:07:57,159
Well, there's no trace of them, sir.

856
01:07:57,242 -- 01:07:59,369
Captain, Lord Vader
demands an update on the pursuit.

857
01:08:01,955 -- 01:08:03,707
Get a shuttle ready.

858
01:08:04,500 -- 01:08:06,335
I shall assume full responsibility
for losing them

859
01:08:06,418 -- 01:08:08,045
and apologise to Lord Vader.

860
01:08:08,462 -- 01:08:10,047
Meanwhile, continue to scan the area.

861
01:08:10,464 -- 01:08:11,965
Yes, Captain Needa.

862
01:08:16,470 -- 01:08:18,722
Use the Force.

863
01:08:18,806 -- 01:08:19,807
Yes.

864
01:08:25,312 -- 01:08:26,897
Now, the stone...

865
01:08:31,318 -- 01:08:33,362
Feel it.

866
01:08:44,540 -- 01:08:46,416
Concentrate!

867
01:09:01,139 -- 01:09:04,434
Oh, no. We'll never get it out now.

868
01:09:04,518 -- 01:09:06,144
So certain are you.

869
01:09:10,107 -- 01:09:13,193
Always with you it cannot be done.

870
01:09:14,695 -- 01:09:16,697
Hear you nothing that I say?

871
01:09:16,780 -- 01:09:18,824
Master, moving stones around
is one thing.

872
01:09:18,907 -- 01:09:20,534
This is totally different.

873
01:09:20,909 -- 01:09:22,578
No! No different!

874
01:09:22,911 -- 01:09:24,955
Only different in your mind.

875
01:09:25,205 -- 01:09:28,792
You must unlearn what you have learned.

876
01:09:29,877 -- 01:09:31,461
All right. I'll give it a try.

877
01:09:31,545 -- 01:09:33,130
No! Try not.

878
01:09:33,630 -- 01:09:35,591
Do.

879
01:09:35,674 -- 01:09:36,925
Or do not.

880
01:09:37,301 -- 01:09:38,927
There is no try.

881
01:10:26,224 -- 01:10:29,519
I can't. It's too big.

882
01:10:30,062 -- 01:10:33,565
Size matters not. Look at me.

883
01:10:33,649 -- 01:10:35,859
Judge me by my size, do you?

884
01:10:35,943 -- 01:10:36,944
Hmm?

885
01:10:37,027 -- 01:10:38,570
Hmph!

886
01:10:38,654 -- 01:10:40,822
And well you should not,

887
01:10:41,281 -- 01:10:44,034
for my ally is the Force.

888
01:10:44,117 -- 01:10:47,037
And a powerful ally it is.

889
01:10:47,329 -- 01:10:49,498
Life creates it,

890
01:10:49,957 -- 01:10:51,458
makes it grow.

891
01:10:52,876 -- 01:10:56,046
Its energy surrounds us...

892
01:10:56,588 -- 01:10:58,048
and binds us.

893
01:10:58,298 -- 01:11:00,467
Luminous beings are we,

894
01:11:00,550 -- 01:11:02,302
not this crude matter.

895
01:11:03,011 -- 01:11:06,640
You must feel the Force around you.

896
01:11:06,890 -- 01:11:10,018
Here, between you, me,

897
01:11:10,560 -- 01:11:13,939
the tree, the rock, everywhere!

898
01:11:14,606 -- 01:11:15,899
Yes...

899
01:11:16,692 -- 01:11:20,404
Even between the land and the ship.

900
01:11:25,325 -- 01:11:27,327
You want the impossible.

901
01:13:01,963 -- 01:13:03,882
Mmm...

902
01:13:15,102 -- 01:13:16,103
I don't...

903
01:13:16,186 -- 01:13:18,522
I don't believe it.

904
01:13:19,147 -- 01:13:21,775
That is why you fail.

905
01:13:41,086 -- 01:13:45,173
Apology accepted, Captain Needa.

906
01:13:52,931 -- 01:13:54,891
Lord Vader, our ships have completed

907
01:13:54,975 -- 01:13:56,560
their scan of the area
and found nothing.

908
01:13:56,643 -- 01:13:58,645
If the iMillennium Falcon/i
went into light speed

909
01:13:58,728 -- 01:14:00,397
it'll be on the other side
of the galaxy by now.

910
01:14:00,480 -- 01:14:01,648
Alert all commands.

911
01:14:02,149 -- 01:14:06,862
Calculate every possible destination
along their last known trajectory.

912
01:14:06,945 -- 01:14:08,196
Yes, my lord. We'll find them.

913
01:14:08,280 -- 01:14:10,323
Don't fail me again...

914
01:14:11,324 -- 01:14:12,409
Admiral.

915
01:14:15,078 -- 01:14:16,705
Alert all commands.

916
01:14:16,788 -- 01:14:18,456
Deploy the fleet.

917
01:14:33,180 -- 01:14:35,515
Captain Solo,
this time you've gone too far.

918
01:14:35,599 -- 01:14:36,725
Gahhh!

919
01:14:36,808 -- 01:14:39,936
No, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca.
Why doesn't anyone listen to me?

920
01:14:40,020 -- 01:14:41,271
The fleet's beginning to break up.

921
01:14:42,189 -- 01:14:44,816
Go back and stand by
the manual release for the landing claw.

922
01:14:47,319 -- 01:14:49,487
I really don't see
how that's going to help.

923
01:14:49,696 -- 01:14:53,158
Surrender is a perfectly acceptable
alternative in extreme circumstances.

924
01:14:53,241 -- 01:14:55,118
The Empire may be gracious enough...

925
01:14:55,202 -- 01:14:56,203
Thank you.

926
01:14:56,286 -- 01:14:57,996
What do you have in your mind
for your next move?

927
01:14:58,079 -- 01:14:59,998
If they follow standard
Imperial procedure,

928
01:15:00,081 -- 01:15:02,042
they'll dump their garbage
before they go to light speed,

929
01:15:02,125 -- 01:15:04,044
and then we just float away.

930
01:15:04,127 -- 01:15:06,838
With the rest of the garbage.
Then what?

931
01:15:06,922 -- 01:15:09,674
Then we got to find a safe port
somewhere around here.

932
01:15:10,050 -- 01:15:11,051
Any ideas?

933
01:15:11,134 -- 01:15:12,469
Where are we?

934
01:15:12,552 -- 01:15:14,054
The Anoat system.

935
01:15:14,137 -- 01:15:16,056
I know that system.
There's not much there.

936
01:15:16,139 -- 01:15:20,018
No. Well, wait. This is interesting.

937
01:15:20,101 -- 01:15:21,186
Lando.

938
01:15:21,269 -- 01:15:22,812
Lando system?

939
01:15:22,896 -- 01:15:26,149
Lando's not a system.
He's a man. Lando Calrissian.

940
01:15:26,483 -- 01:15:29,569
He's a card player, gambler, scoundrel.

941
01:15:29,653 -- 01:15:31,655
- You'd like him.
- Thanks.

942
01:15:31,738 -- 01:15:34,908
Bespin. It's pretty far,
but I think we can make it.

943
01:15:35,533 -- 01:15:37,202
A mining colony?

944
01:15:37,285 -- 01:15:39,329
Yeah, a tibanna gas mine.

945
01:15:39,746 -- 01:15:42,332
Lando conned somebody out of it.

946
01:15:42,415 -- 01:15:45,252
We go back a long way,
Lando and me.

947
01:15:46,086 -- 01:15:47,295
Can you trust him?

948
01:15:47,379 -- 01:15:51,716
No. But he's got no love for the Empire,
I can tell you that.

949
01:15:51,800 -- 01:15:54,844
Here we go, Chewie. Stand by.

950
01:15:54,970 -- 01:15:56,054
Detach.

951
01:16:03,270 -- 01:16:04,771
You do have your moments.

952
01:16:05,188 -- 01:16:06,523
Not many of them,

953
01:16:06,606 -- 01:16:08,275
but you do have them.

954
01:16:42,892 -- 01:16:44,561
Concentrate.

955
01:16:44,644 -- 01:16:47,939
Feel the Force flow.

956
01:16:48,023 -- 01:16:50,191
Yes.

957
01:16:57,490 -- 01:16:58,575
Good.

958
01:16:59,409 -- 01:17:00,910
Calm.

959
01:17:00,994 -- 01:17:02,412
Yes.

960
01:17:02,996 -- 01:17:05,957
Through the Force, things you will see.

961
01:17:06,041 -- 01:17:09,502
Other places. The future. The past.

962
01:17:09,586 -- 01:17:12,172
Old friends long gone.

963
01:17:14,341 -- 01:17:15,592
Han?

964
01:17:16,092 -- 01:17:17,177
Leia!

965
01:17:20,680 -- 01:17:22,515
Hmm...

966
01:17:22,599 -- 01:17:24,100
Control, control.

967
01:17:24,184 -- 01:17:26,102
You must learn control!

968
01:17:29,064 -- 01:17:32,359
I saw... I saw a city in the clouds.

969
01:17:32,942 -- 01:17:33,985
Hmm...

970
01:17:34,069 -- 01:17:36,571
Friends you have there.

971
01:17:37,530 -- 01:17:38,615
They were in pain.

972
01:17:39,449 -- 01:17:41,201
It is the future you see.

973
01:17:42,702 -- 01:17:43,703
Future?

974
01:17:52,337 -- 01:17:53,630
Will they die?

975
01:17:56,966 -- 01:17:58,468
Difficult to see.

976
01:17:59,344 -- 01:18:01,346
Always in motion is the future.

977
01:18:04,307 -- 01:18:06,017
I've got to go to them.

978
01:18:07,602 -- 01:18:10,230
Decide you must how to serve them best.

979
01:18:10,605 -- 01:18:13,108
If you leave now, help them you could,

980
01:18:14,651 -- 01:18:18,279
but you would destroy all
for which they have fought and suffered.

981
01:18:32,085 -- 01:18:35,171
No, I don't have a landing permit.

982
01:18:35,255 -- 01:18:39,175
I'm trying to reach Lando Calrissian.

983
01:18:39,259 -- 01:18:41,344
Wait a minute! Let me explain!

984
01:18:41,428 -- 01:18:43,179
iYou will not deviate
from your present course./i

985
01:18:43,263 -- 01:18:44,514
Rather touchy, aren't they?

986
01:18:44,764 -- 01:18:46,307
I thought you knew this person.

987
01:18:46,391 -- 01:18:48,309
Gaah!

988
01:18:49,060 -- 01:18:50,228
That was a long time ago.

989
01:18:50,311 -- 01:18:51,729
I'm sure he's forgotten about that.

990
01:19:00,488 -- 01:19:04,242
iPermission granted to land
on Platform 3-2-7./i

991
01:19:04,325 -- 01:19:05,702
Thank you.

992
01:19:06,494 -- 01:19:07,704
Nothing to worry about.

993
01:19:07,787 -- 01:19:09,497
We go way back, Lando and me.

994
01:19:09,998 -- 01:19:11,374
Who's worried?

995
01:19:59,797 -- 01:20:01,549
Oh. No one to meet us.

996
01:20:02,842 -- 01:20:03,885
I don't like this.

997
01:20:05,178 -- 01:20:06,429
Well, what would you like?

998
01:20:06,513 -- 01:20:08,223
They did let us land.

999
01:20:08,306 -- 01:20:10,975
Look, don't worry.
Everything's going to be fine.

1000
01:20:11,059 -- 01:20:12,227
Trust me.

1001
01:20:17,148 -- 01:20:19,025
See? My friend.

1002
01:20:23,821 -- 01:20:25,782
Keep your eyes open, huh?

1003
01:20:26,199 -- 01:20:27,784
Gahhh!

1004
01:20:28,326 -- 01:20:29,452
Hey!

1005
01:20:30,078 -- 01:20:31,287
Why, you slimy,

1006
01:20:31,371 -- 01:20:34,082
double-crossing, no-good swindler.

1007
01:20:34,707 -- 01:20:38,503
You've got a lot of guts coming here
after what you pulled.

1008
01:20:49,556 -- 01:20:52,934
How you doin', you old pirate?
So good to see you!

1009
01:20:54,310 -- 01:20:56,229
Well, he seems very friendly.

1010
01:20:56,312 -- 01:20:57,313
Yes.

1011
01:20:57,397 -- 01:20:59,399
Very friendly.

1012
01:20:59,482 -- 01:21:00,775
What are you doing here?

1013
01:21:00,858 -- 01:21:03,319
Ah, repairs.
I thought you could help me out.

1014
01:21:03,403 -- 01:21:04,529
What have you done to my ship?

1015
01:21:04,612 -- 01:21:05,613
Your ship?

1016
01:21:05,863 -- 01:21:07,490
Hey, remember,

1017
01:21:07,574 -- 01:21:09,659
you lost her to me fair and square.

1018
01:21:10,159 -- 01:21:11,619
And how you doin', Chewbacca?

1019
01:21:11,703 -- 01:21:12,704
Gahh!

1020
01:21:12,787 -- 01:21:14,122
You still hanging around
with this loser?

1021
01:21:14,706 -- 01:21:16,207
Gahhh!

1022
01:21:17,542 -- 01:21:19,836
Hello. What have we here?

1023
01:21:20,670 -- 01:21:22,338
Welcome, I'm Lando Calrissian.

1024
01:21:22,422 -- 01:21:24,215
I'm the administrator of this facility.

1025
01:21:24,591 -- 01:21:26,217
And who might you be?

1026
01:21:26,301 -- 01:21:27,385
Leia.

1027
01:21:27,885 -- 01:21:29,345
Welcome, Leia.

1028
01:21:32,265 -- 01:21:35,560
All right, all right, you old smoothie.

1029
01:21:35,643 -- 01:21:38,771
Hello, sir. I am C-3PO,
human-cyborg relations.

1030
01:21:38,855 -- 01:21:40,189
My facilities are at your...

1031
01:21:41,065 -- 01:21:42,191
Well, really!

1032
01:21:42,275 -- 01:21:43,943
What's wrong with the iFalcon?/i

1033
01:21:44,027 -- 01:21:45,028
Hyperdrive.

1034
01:21:45,111 -- 01:21:46,779
- I'll get my people to work on her.
- Good.

1035
01:21:46,863 -- 01:21:48,615
That ship saved my life
quite a few times.

1036
01:21:48,698 -- 01:21:51,618
She's the fastest
hunk of junk in the galaxy.

1037
01:21:52,577 -- 01:21:55,413
How's the gas mine?
Still paying off for you?

1038
01:21:55,496 -- 01:21:56,748
Oh, not as well as I'd like.

1039
01:21:56,831 -- 01:21:59,208
We're a small outpost
and not very self-sufficient.

1040
01:21:59,292 -- 01:22:03,755
I've had supply problems of every kind.
I've had labour difficulties.

1041
01:22:03,838 -- 01:22:05,506
What's so funny?

1042
01:22:06,132 -- 01:22:07,467
You. Listen to you.

1043
01:22:07,967 -- 01:22:09,344
You sound like a businessman,

1044
01:22:09,427 -- 01:22:10,720
a responsible leader.

1045
01:22:10,970 -- 01:22:13,139
Who'd have thought that, huh?

1046
01:22:13,222 -- 01:22:15,683
Seeing you brings back a few things.

1047
01:22:16,184 -- 01:22:17,226
Yeah.

1048
01:22:17,477 -- 01:22:19,228
Yeah, I'm responsible these days.

1049
01:22:20,396 -- 01:22:22,899
It's the price you pay
for being successful.

1050
01:22:25,526 -- 01:22:27,612
Ooh. Nice to see a familiar face.

1051
01:22:27,695 -- 01:22:28,696
iE chu ta!/i

1052
01:22:28,780 -- 01:22:30,073
How rude!

1053
01:22:31,866 -- 01:22:33,951
That sounds like an R2 unit in there.

1054
01:22:34,035 -- 01:22:35,453
I wonder if... Hello?

1055
01:22:37,789 -- 01:22:39,123
How interesting.

1056
01:22:39,207 -- 01:22:40,375
Who are you?

1057
01:22:40,458 -- 01:22:42,710
Oh, my! I... I'm terribly sorry.

1058
01:22:42,794 -- 01:22:44,003
I didn't mean to intrude.

1059
01:22:44,087 -- 01:22:45,213
No, please don't get up.

1060
01:22:51,511 -- 01:22:52,845
Gahhh.

1061
01:23:03,398 -- 01:23:05,900
Luke, you must complete the training.

1062
01:23:06,317 -- 01:23:09,779
I can't keep the vision out of my head.
They're my friends. I got to help them.

1063
01:23:09,862 -- 01:23:12,031
You must not go.

1064
01:23:12,115 -- 01:23:13,950
But Han and Leia will die if I don't.

1065
01:23:14,033 -- 01:23:15,451
iYou don't know that./i

1066
01:23:17,912 -- 01:23:19,831
Even Yoda cannot see their fate.

1067
01:23:20,915 -- 01:23:22,291
But I can help them.

1068
01:23:22,375 -- 01:23:23,710
I feel the Force.

1069
01:23:23,793 -- 01:23:25,378
But you cannot control it.

1070
01:23:25,753 -- 01:23:27,880
This is a dangerous time for you,

1071
01:23:28,297 -- 01:23:31,801
when you will be tempted
by the dark side of the Force.

1072
01:23:31,884 -- 01:23:34,846
Yes! Yes! To Obi-Wan you listen.

1073
01:23:35,638 -- 01:23:39,434
The cave.
Remember your failure at the cave.

1074
01:23:39,517 -- 01:23:41,686
But I've learned so much since then.

1075
01:23:41,769 -- 01:23:44,230
Master Yoda, I promise to return
and to finish what I've begun.

1076
01:23:44,313 -- 01:23:45,565
You have my word.

1077
01:23:46,691 -- 01:23:49,485
It is you and your abilities
the Emperor wants.

1078
01:23:49,569 -- 01:23:52,405
That is why your friends
are made to suffer.

1079
01:23:53,531 -- 01:23:55,491
That's why I have to go.

1080
01:23:55,825 -- 01:24:00,872
Luke, I don't want to lose you
to the Emperor the way I lost Vader.

1081
01:24:01,247 -- 01:24:02,582
You won't.

1082
01:24:03,124 -- 01:24:04,584
Stopped they must be.

1083
01:24:04,667 -- 01:24:06,961
On this all depends.

1084
01:24:07,336 -- 01:24:09,505
Only a fully trained Jedi knight,

1085
01:24:09,589 -- 01:24:11,424
with the Force as his ally,

1086
01:24:11,507 -- 01:24:14,010
will conquer Vader and his Emperor.

1087
01:24:14,302 -- 01:24:16,345
If you end your training now,

1088
01:24:16,637 -- 01:24:20,683
if you choose the quick
and easy path, as Vader did,

1089
01:24:20,933 -- 01:24:23,519
you will become an agent of evil.

1090
01:24:23,603 -- 01:24:24,604
Patience.

1091
01:24:25,313 -- 01:24:26,814
And sacrifice Han and Leia?

1092
01:24:27,190 -- 01:24:30,943
If you honour
what they fight for... yes.

1093
01:24:31,027 -- 01:24:32,737
If you choose to face Vader,

1094
01:24:32,820 -- 01:24:34,113
you will do it alone.

1095
01:24:34,405 -- 01:24:36,073
I cannot interfere.

1096
01:24:38,242 -- 01:24:39,452
I understand.

1097
01:24:44,791 -- 01:24:46,584
R2.

1098
01:24:46,709 -- 01:24:48,127
Fire up the converters.

1099
01:24:51,005 -- 01:24:52,048
Luke!

1100
01:24:53,132 -- 01:24:55,384
Don't give in to hate.

1101
01:24:55,468 -- 01:24:58,054
That leads to the dark side.

1102
01:24:58,346 -- 01:24:59,639
Strong is Vader.

1103
01:24:59,722 -- 01:25:02,642
Mind what you have learned.
Save you it can.

1104
01:25:03,392 -- 01:25:04,393
I will.

1105
01:25:04,727 -- 01:25:06,103
And I'll return.

1106
01:25:06,187 -- 01:25:07,772
I promise.

1107
01:25:14,529 -- 01:25:15,780
Told you, I did.

1108
01:25:15,863 -- 01:25:17,615
Reckless is he.

1109
01:25:17,698 -- 01:25:18,783
Now...

1110
01:25:19,534 -- 01:25:20,952
matters are worse.

1111
01:25:21,035 -- 01:25:23,329
iThat boy is our last hope./i

1112
01:25:23,412 -- 01:25:25,873
No, there is another.

1113
01:25:58,447 -- 01:25:59,448
The ship's almost finished.

1114
01:25:59,532 -- 01:26:01,701
Two or three more things
and we're in great shape.

1115
01:26:01,784 -- 01:26:03,870
The sooner the better.
Something is wrong here.

1116
01:26:03,953 -- 01:26:05,955
No one has seen
or knows anything about 3PO.

1117
01:26:06,038 -- 01:26:08,457
He's been gone too long
to have gotten lost.

1118
01:26:08,541 -- 01:26:12,587
Relax. I'll talk to Lando
and see what I can find out.

1119
01:26:13,337 -- 01:26:15,464
I don't trust Lando.

1120
01:26:15,798 -- 01:26:17,884
Well, I don't trust him either.

1121
01:26:17,967 -- 01:26:20,595
But he is my friend. Besides...

1122
01:26:20,678 -- 01:26:22,555
we'll soon be gone.

1123
01:26:23,848 -- 01:26:25,558
Then you're as good as gone,
aren't you?

1124
01:26:59,258 -- 01:27:00,635
Gaahh!

1125
01:27:00,718 -- 01:27:01,761
What happened?

1126
01:27:03,596 -- 01:27:04,805
Where?

1127
01:27:04,889 -- 01:27:06,182
Gahhh!

1128
01:27:06,265 -- 01:27:07,391
Found him in a junk pile?

1129
01:27:07,934 -- 01:27:10,770
Oh, what a mess.
Chewie, you think you can repair him?

1130
01:27:11,103 -- 01:27:13,022
Gahhh!

1131
01:27:13,105 -- 01:27:14,857
Lando's got people that can fix him.

1132
01:27:14,941 -- 01:27:16,275
No, thanks.

1133
01:27:18,069 -- 01:27:20,071
I'm sorry, am I interrupting anything?

1134
01:27:20,613 -- 01:27:21,906
Not really.

1135
01:27:25,576 -- 01:27:27,662
You look absolutely beautiful.

1136
01:27:27,995 -- 01:27:31,123
You truly belong here with us
among the clouds.

1137
01:27:31,207 -- 01:27:32,708
Thank you.

1138
01:27:32,792 -- 01:27:34,418
Would you join me
for a little refreshment?

1139
01:27:35,628 -- 01:27:37,129
Everyone's invited, of course.

1140
01:27:39,215 -- 01:27:40,716
Having trouble with your droid?

1141
01:27:40,800 -- 01:27:42,468
No, no problem.

1142
01:27:42,551 -- 01:27:43,594
Why?

1143
01:27:52,395 -- 01:27:54,188
You see,
since we're a small operation,

1144
01:27:54,563 -- 01:27:58,234
we don't fall into
the jurisdiction of the Empire.

1145
01:27:58,317 -- 01:27:59,944
So you're part
of the Mining Guild, then?

1146
01:28:00,027 -- 01:28:03,239
No, not actually. Our operation
is small enough not to be noticed.

1147
01:28:03,322 -- 01:28:05,241
Which is advantageous for everybody,

1148
01:28:05,324 -- 01:28:09,412
since our customers are anxious to avoid
attracting attention to themselves.

1149
01:28:10,162 -- 01:28:12,081
Aren't you afraid the Empire's
going to find out

1150
01:28:12,164 -- 01:28:14,166
about this little operation,
shut you down?

1151
01:28:14,250 -- 01:28:15,251
It's always been a danger

1152
01:28:15,334 -- 01:28:17,003
that looms like a shadow
over everything we've built.

1153
01:28:17,086 -- 01:28:19,588
But things have developed
that'll ensure security.

1154
01:28:19,672 -- 01:28:22,925
I've just made a deal that will keep
the Empire out of here forever.

1155
01:28:33,352 -- 01:28:36,230
We would be honoured
if you would join us.

1156
01:28:42,945 -- 01:28:45,614
I had no choice.
They arrived right before you did.

1157
01:28:46,157 -- 01:28:47,366
I'm sorry.

1158
01:28:51,787 -- 01:28:53,289
I'm sorry, too.

1159
01:28:55,207 -- 01:28:57,084
Gahhh.

1160
01:29:08,012 -- 01:29:09,180
No, 3PO's with them.

1161
01:29:10,723 -- 01:29:12,349
Just hang on. We're almost there.

1162
01:30:10,282 -- 01:30:11,450
Oh, ah, ooh, ah.

1163
01:30:11,909 -- 01:30:13,452
I'm terribly sorry.

1164
01:30:13,536 -- 01:30:15,704
I didn't mean to intrude.
No, please don't get up.

1165
01:30:20,459 -- 01:30:23,295
No! Secret. Stormtroopers?

1166
01:30:23,379 -- 01:30:25,798
Here? We're in danger!

1167
01:30:25,881 -- 01:30:27,299
I must tell the others.

1168
01:30:27,383 -- 01:30:28,467
Oh, no, I've been shot!

1169
01:30:55,995 -- 01:30:57,329
Lord Vader.

1170
01:30:58,122 -- 01:31:02,918
You may take Captain Solo to
Jabba the Hutt after I have Skywalker.

1171
01:31:03,002 -- 01:31:04,920
He's no good to me dead.

1172
01:31:05,004 -- 01:31:07,923
He will not be
permanently damaged.

1173
01:31:10,176 -- 01:31:13,179
Lord Vader,
what about Leia and the Wookiee?

1174
01:31:13,262 -- 01:31:16,098
They must never again leave this city.

1175
01:31:16,182 -- 01:31:17,766
That was never a condition
of our agreement,

1176
01:31:17,850 -- 01:31:19,351
nor was giving Han
to this bounty hunter.

1177
01:31:19,435 -- 01:31:23,564
Perhaps you think
you're being treated unfairly?

1178
01:31:25,524 -- 01:31:26,567
No.

1179
01:31:26,650 -- 01:31:30,946
Good. It would be unfortunate
if I had to leave a garrison here.

1180
01:31:32,865 -- 01:31:35,242
This deal is getting worse all the time.

1181
01:31:36,452 -- 01:31:38,871
Oh, yes, that's very good.
I like that.

1182
01:31:38,954 -- 01:31:40,289
Oh!

1183
01:31:40,748 -- 01:31:43,250
Something's not right
because now I can't see.

1184
01:31:43,751 -- 01:31:47,129
Oh, oh, oh, that's much better.

1185
01:31:47,963 -- 01:31:49,506
Wait! Wait!

1186
01:31:49,590 -- 01:31:51,926
Oh, my! What have you done?

1187
01:31:52,009 -- 01:31:55,137
I'm backwards,
you flea-bitten furball!

1188
01:31:55,304 -- 01:31:58,224
Only an overgrown mophead like you
would be stupid enough...

1189
01:32:12,863 -- 01:32:14,281
I feel terrible.

1190
01:32:14,365 -- 01:32:15,699
Gahhh.

1191
01:32:29,838 -- 01:32:31,632
Why are they doing this?

1192
01:32:34,551 -- 01:32:36,845
They never even asked me
any questions.

1193
01:32:42,101 -- 01:32:43,269
Lando.

1194
01:32:46,981 -- 01:32:48,065
Get out of here, Lando.

1195
01:32:48,148 -- 01:32:49,525
Shut up and listen!

1196
01:32:49,608 -- 01:32:51,110
Vader's agreed
to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.

1197
01:32:51,193 -- 01:32:52,319
Over to you?

1198
01:32:52,403 -- 01:32:53,988
They'll have to stay here,
but at least they'll be safe.

1199
01:32:54,071 -- 01:32:55,072
What about Han?

1200
01:32:55,155 -- 01:32:56,282
Vader's given him to the bounty hunter.

1201
01:32:56,615 -- 01:32:58,200
Vader wants us all dead.

1202
01:32:58,284 -- 01:33:01,245
He doesn't want you at all.
He's after somebody called Skywalker.

1203
01:33:02,037 -- 01:33:04,248
- Luke.
- Lord Vader set a trap for him.

1204
01:33:04,331 -- 01:33:05,416
And we're the bait!

1205
01:33:05,499 -- 01:33:07,251
He's on his way.

1206
01:33:08,168 -- 01:33:10,379
You fixed us all real good, didn't you?

1207
01:33:10,462 -- 01:33:12,172
My friend.

1208
01:33:14,091 -- 01:33:15,175
Stop!

1209
01:33:17,344 -- 01:33:18,762
I've done all I can.

1210
01:33:19,346 -- 01:33:22,016
I'm sorry I couldn't do better,
but I've got my own problems.

1211
01:33:22,099 -- 01:33:23,350
Yeah.

1212
01:33:23,642 -- 01:33:25,561
You're a real hero.

1213
01:33:36,030 -- 01:33:37,990
You certainly have a way with people.

1214
01:33:42,077 -- 01:33:43,746
Ah... Ah...

1215
01:33:52,755 -- 01:33:54,923
This facility is crude,

1216
01:33:55,007 -- 01:33:57,843
but it should be adequate
to freeze Skywalker

1217
01:33:57,926 -- 01:34:00,304
for his journey to the Emperor.

1218
01:34:00,387 -- 01:34:03,265
Lord Vader,
ship approaching, X-wing class.

1219
01:34:03,349 -- 01:34:06,852
Good. Monitor Skywalker
and allow him to land.

1220
01:34:08,062 -- 01:34:11,231
Lord Vader, we only use
this facility for carbon freezing.

1221
01:34:11,315 -- 01:34:12,983
You put him in there, it might kill him.

1222
01:34:13,067 -- 01:34:15,986
I do not want
the Emperor's prize damaged.

1223
01:34:16,111 -- 01:34:18,947
We will test it on Captain Solo.

1224
01:34:43,180 -- 01:34:44,556
If only you'd attached my legs,

1225
01:34:44,640 -- 01:34:46,600
I wouldn't be in
this ridiculous position.

1226
01:34:47,267 -- 01:34:50,187
Now remember, Chewbacca,
you have a responsibility for me,

1227
01:34:50,270 -- 01:34:52,189
so don't do anything foolish.

1228
01:35:05,744 -- 01:35:07,079
What's going on...

1229
01:35:07,162 -- 01:35:08,330
buddy?

1230
01:35:08,872 -- 01:35:11,333
You're being put into carbon freeze.

1231
01:35:11,417 -- 01:35:14,753
What if he doesn't survive?
He's worth a lot to me.

1232
01:35:14,837 -- 01:35:17,297
The Empire
will compensate you if he dies.

1233
01:35:17,589 -- 01:35:18,715
Put him in.

1234
01:35:21,468 -- 01:35:22,928
No, no, no!

1235
01:35:23,554 -- 01:35:25,722
Stop, Chewie, stop, stop!

1236
01:35:26,849 -- 01:35:28,934
Yes, stop, please!
I'm not ready to die!

1237
01:35:29,017 -- 01:35:31,353
Hey! Hey! Listen to me, Chewie.

1238
01:35:31,770 -- 01:35:33,021
This won't help me.

1239
01:35:33,105 -- 01:35:34,982
Hey, save your strength.

1240
01:35:35,065 -- 01:35:36,608
There will be another time.

1241
01:35:37,901 -- 01:35:39,695
The princess...

1242
01:35:39,778 -- 01:35:41,613
You have to take care of her.

1243
01:35:43,782 -- 01:35:46,160
Do you hear me? Huh?

1244
01:35:59,673 -- 01:36:01,049
I love you.

1245
01:36:01,467 -- 01:36:02,759
I know.

1246
01:36:23,864 -- 01:36:25,449
Gahhh!

1247
01:36:31,830 -- 01:36:33,874
What's going on? Turn around!

1248
01:36:33,957 -- 01:36:35,334
Chewbacca, I can't see.

1249
01:36:50,098 -- 01:36:52,017
Gahhh.

1250
01:37:33,809 -- 01:37:36,645
Oh, they've encased him in carbonite.

1251
01:37:36,728 -- 01:37:38,480
He should be quite well protected,

1252
01:37:38,564 -- 01:37:40,482
if he survived the freezing process,
that is.

1253
01:37:40,566 -- 01:37:43,110
Well, Calrissian, did he survive?

1254
01:37:43,193 -- 01:37:45,070
Yes, he's alive.

1255
01:37:45,779 -- 01:37:47,614
And in perfect hibernation.

1256
01:37:48,240 -- 01:37:50,659
He's all yours, bounty hunter.

1257
01:37:51,159 -- 01:37:53,370
Reset the chamber for Skywalker.

1258
01:37:55,622 -- 01:37:57,541
Skywalker has just landed, lord.

1259
01:37:57,791 -- 01:38:01,128
Good. See to it that
he finds his way in here.

1260
01:38:05,757 -- 01:38:10,304
Calrissian, take the princess
and the Wookiee to my ship.

1261
01:38:10,387 -- 01:38:12,514
You said they'd be left in the city
under my supervision.

1262
01:38:12,598 -- 01:38:14,391
I am altering the deal.

1263
01:38:14,474 -- 01:38:16,977
Pray I don't alter it any further.

1264
01:39:53,448 -- 01:39:54,616
Gahhh!

1265
01:39:54,700 -- 01:39:57,369
Luke! Luke, don't, it's a trap!

1266
01:39:58,745 -- 01:39:59,871
It's a trap!

1267
01:40:45,834 -- 01:40:48,712
The Force is with you, young Skywalker.

1268
01:40:50,589 -- 01:40:53,049
But you are not a Jedi yet.

1269
01:41:54,861 -- 01:41:56,238
Well done.

1270
01:41:58,073 -- 01:42:02,118
Hold them in the security tower.
And keep it quiet. Move.

1271
01:42:07,916 -- 01:42:09,793
What do you think you're doing?

1272
01:42:09,876 -- 01:42:10,919
We're getting out of here.

1273
01:42:11,002 -- 01:42:12,796
I knew all along.
It had to be a mistake.

1274
01:42:12,879 -- 01:42:15,757
Do you think that after what you did
to Han, we're going to trust you?

1275
01:42:17,175 -- 01:42:18,468
I had no choice.

1276
01:42:18,552 -- 01:42:20,011
What are you doing?
Trust him! Trust him!

1277
01:42:20,095 -- 01:42:23,098
Oh, we understand, don't we, Chewie?
He had no choice.

1278
01:42:23,181 -- 01:42:24,850
I'm just trying to help.

1279
01:42:24,933 -- 01:42:26,726
We don't need any of your help.

1280
01:42:32,274 -- 01:42:33,275
What?

1281
01:42:33,358 -- 01:42:34,359
Han...

1282
01:42:34,442 -- 01:42:35,569
It sounds like Han.

1283
01:42:35,652 -- 01:42:38,154
There's still a chance to save Han...

1284
01:42:39,030 -- 01:42:41,449
at the east...

1285
01:42:41,533 -- 01:42:43,118
platform.

1286
01:42:43,660 -- 01:42:44,661
Chewie.

1287
01:42:47,163 -- 01:42:49,583
I'm terribly sorry
about all this.

1288
01:42:49,666 -- 01:42:51,459
After all, he's only a Wookiee.

1289
01:42:51,918 -- 01:42:54,170
Put Captain Solo
in the cargo hold.

1290
01:43:10,145 -- 01:43:12,647
R2, R2, where have you been?

1291
01:43:12,731 -- 01:43:14,566
Wait. Turn around, you woolly...

1292
01:43:15,442 -- 01:43:18,612
Hurry! Hurry! We're trying to save Han
from the bounty hunter.

1293
01:43:20,739 -- 01:43:23,617
Well, at least
you're still in one piece.

1294
01:43:23,700 -- 01:43:25,160
Look what's happened to me.

1295
01:43:38,006 -- 01:43:40,300
Oh, no! Chewie, they're behind you!

1296
01:43:53,647 -- 01:43:55,941
You have learned much, young one.

1297
01:43:56,024 -- 01:43:58,109
You'll find I'm full of surprises.

1298
01:44:09,496 -- 01:44:12,874
Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker.

1299
01:44:13,291 -- 01:44:15,585
Obi-Wan knew this to be true.

1300
01:44:16,127 -- 01:44:17,128
No.

1301
01:44:21,675 -- 01:44:22,676
Aaah!

1302
01:44:24,219 -- 01:44:25,762
All too easy.

1303
01:44:30,767 -- 01:44:33,561
Perhaps you're not as strong
as the Emperor thought.

1304
01:44:36,606 -- 01:44:38,149
Impressive.

1305
01:44:40,068 -- 01:44:41,653
Most impressive.

1306
01:44:44,322 -- 01:44:46,032
Aaah!

1307
01:44:48,994 -- 01:44:50,954
Obi-Wan has taught you well.

1308
01:44:51,037 -- 01:44:53,081
You have controlled your fear.

1309
01:44:55,542 -- 01:44:56,543
Now...

1310
01:44:56,751 -- 01:44:59,087
release your anger.

1311
01:44:59,170 -- 01:45:01,881
Only your hatred can destroy me.

1312
01:45:12,934 -- 01:45:14,144
Oh!

1313
01:47:12,512 -- 01:47:14,764
The security code has been changed.

1314
01:47:14,848 -- 01:47:18,101
R2, you can tell the computer
to override the security systems.

1315
01:47:18,977 -- 01:47:20,103
R2, hurry!

1316
01:47:23,273 -- 01:47:25,108
Attention. This is Lando Calrissian.

1317
01:47:25,400 -- 01:47:27,944
iAttention. The Empire
has taken control of the city./i

1318
01:47:28,027 -- 01:47:31,531
I advise everyone to leave
before more Imperial troops arrive.

1319
01:47:37,954 -- 01:47:39,122
This way.

1320
01:47:39,205 -- 01:47:41,749
Well, don't blame me.
I'm an interpreter.

1321
01:47:41,833 -- 01:47:44,502
I'm not supposed to know a power socket
from a computer terminal.

1322
01:48:05,732 -- 01:48:08,693
Ah! We're not interested in the
hyperdrive on the iMillennium Falcon./i

1323
01:48:08,776 -- 01:48:09,777
It's fixed!

1324
01:48:13,656 -- 01:48:15,992
Just open the door, you stupid lump!

1325
01:48:25,501 -- 01:48:27,128
I never doubted you for a second.

1326
01:48:27,212 -- 01:48:28,254
Wonderful!

1327
01:48:51,069 -- 01:48:53,154
Ouch! Oh! That hurts!

1328
01:48:53,238 -- 01:48:55,406
Bend down, you thoughtless... Ow!

1329
01:49:00,870 -- 01:49:01,913
Leia!

1330
01:49:02,497 -- 01:49:03,539
Go!

1331
01:49:10,004 -- 01:49:12,507
I thought that hairy beast
would be the end of me.

1332
01:49:13,675 -- 01:49:15,051
Of course I've looked better.

1333
01:50:08,938 -- 01:50:10,315
You are beaten.

1334
01:50:10,815 -- 01:50:12,483
It is useless to resist.

1335
01:50:12,734 -- 01:50:15,820
Don't let yourself be destroyed
as Obi-Wan did.

1336
01:50:26,956 -- 01:50:28,458
Aah!

1337
01:50:31,878 -- 01:50:33,546
There is no escape.

1338
01:50:34,255 -- 01:50:36,549
Don't make me destroy you.

1339
01:50:38,634 -- 01:50:39,677
Luke,

1340
01:50:40,011 -- 01:50:43,222
you do not yet realise your importance.

1341
01:50:43,306 -- 01:50:46,267
You have only begun
to discover your power.

1342
01:50:46,351 -- 01:50:50,646
Join me,
and I will complete your training.

1343
01:50:50,730 -- 01:50:53,107
With our combined strength,

1344
01:50:53,191 -- 01:50:58,654
we can end this destructive conflict
and bring order to the galaxy.

1345
01:50:58,738 -- 01:51:00,281
I'll never join you!

1346
01:51:00,615 -- 01:51:04,535
If you only knew the power
of the dark side.

1347
01:51:05,328 -- 01:51:09,540
Obi-Wan never told you
what happened to your father.

1348
01:51:09,624 -- 01:51:11,417
He told me enough!

1349
01:51:14,087 -- 01:51:15,588
He told me you killed him.

1350
01:51:15,671 -- 01:51:17,048
No.

1351
01:51:17,215 -- 01:51:19,384
I am your father.

1352
01:51:23,763 -- 01:51:25,264
No.

1353
01:51:26,015 -- 01:51:27,392
No.

1354
01:51:27,892 -- 01:51:29,519
That's not true.

1355
01:51:30,978 -- 01:51:32,647
That's impossible!

1356
01:51:32,730 -- 01:51:36,150
Search your feelings.
You know it to be true.

1357
01:51:37,318 -- 01:51:39,821
No!

1358
01:51:40,113 -- 01:51:42,490
No!

1359
01:51:43,408 -- 01:51:44,492
Luke.

1360
01:51:44,575 -- 01:51:46,828
You can destroy the Emperor.

1361
01:51:46,994 -- 01:51:48,955
He has foreseen this.

1362
01:51:49,122 -- 01:51:51,749
It is your destiny.

1363
01:51:52,041 -- 01:51:57,880
Join me, and together we can rule
the galaxy as father and son.

1364
01:52:09,183 -- 01:52:10,560
Come with me.

1365
01:52:11,018 -- 01:52:12,645
It is the only way.

1366
01:52:44,469 -- 01:52:45,553
Ah!

1367
01:53:19,420 -- 01:53:20,671
Ben.

1368
01:53:21,714 -- 01:53:23,424
Ben, please.

1369
01:53:33,100 -- 01:53:34,310
Ben.

1370
01:53:39,565 -- 01:53:40,858
Leia.

1371
01:53:51,452 -- 01:53:52,703
Hear me.

1372
01:53:54,622 -- 01:53:55,915
Leia.

1373
01:53:56,207 -- 01:53:57,625
Luke.

1374
01:53:59,961 -- 01:54:01,629
We've got to go back.

1375
01:54:01,712 -- 01:54:03,673
- What?
- I know where Luke is.

1376
01:54:03,756 -- 01:54:04,882
What about those fighters?

1377
01:54:05,800 -- 01:54:07,218
Chewie, just do it.

1378
01:54:07,301 -- 01:54:08,636
But what about Vader?

1379
01:54:08,719 -- 01:54:10,054
All right, all right, all right!

1380
01:54:17,937 -- 01:54:21,983
Alert my Star Destroyer
to prepare for my arrival.

1381
01:54:32,702 -- 01:54:34,662
Look, someone's up there.

1382
01:54:36,247 -- 01:54:37,290
It's Luke.

1383
01:54:37,373 -- 01:54:38,749
Chewie, slow down.

1384
01:54:38,833 -- 01:54:40,251
Slow down. We'll get under him.

1385
01:54:40,334 -- 01:54:41,961
Lando, open the top hatch.

1386
01:54:58,019 -- 01:54:59,270
Okay.

1387
01:54:59,353 -- 01:55:00,479
Easy, Chewie.

1388
01:55:00,563 -- 01:55:01,606
Gahrrr.

1389
01:55:22,293 -- 01:55:23,294
Lando?

1390
01:55:23,377 -- 01:55:24,462
iOkay, let's go./i

1391
01:55:41,562 -- 01:55:43,731
Oh, Leia.

1392
01:55:44,023 -- 01:55:45,316
All right, Chewie, let's go.

1393
01:56:20,935 -- 01:56:22,019
I'll be back.

1394
01:56:28,901 -- 01:56:30,319
Star Destroyer.

1395
01:56:35,366 -- 01:56:37,618
All right, Chewie.
Ready for light speed.

1396
01:56:38,160 -- 01:56:40,371
If your people
fixed the hyperdrive.

1397
01:56:40,454 -- 01:56:42,707
All the coordinates are set.
It's now or never.

1398
01:56:42,790 -- 01:56:43,916
Punch it!

1399
01:56:54,927 -- 01:56:56,387
They told me they fixed it.

1400
01:56:57,138 -- 01:56:59,056
I trusted them to fix it!

1401
01:56:59,432 -- 01:57:01,267
It's not my fault!

1402
01:57:07,148 -- 01:57:09,900
They'll be in range of
our tractor beam in moments, lord.

1403
01:57:09,984 -- 01:57:13,779
Did your men deactivate
the hyperdrive on the iMillennium Falcon?/i

1404
01:57:13,863 -- 01:57:14,864
Yes, my lord.

1405
01:57:14,947 -- 01:57:19,744
Good. Prepare the boarding party
and set your weapons for stun.

1406
01:57:19,827 -- 01:57:22,872
- Yes, my lord. Lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.

1407
01:57:24,165 -- 01:57:27,042
Noisy brute.
Why don't we just go into light speed?

1408
01:57:27,460 -- 01:57:28,753
We can't?

1409
01:57:29,044 -- 01:57:31,922
How would you know
the hyperdrive is deactivated?

1410
01:57:35,092 -- 01:57:37,553
The city's central computer told you?

1411
01:57:38,012 -- 01:57:40,931
R2-D2, you know better
than to trust a strange computer.

1412
01:57:41,015 -- 01:57:42,057
Ouch!

1413
01:57:42,141 -- 01:57:44,101
Pay attention to what you're doing!

1414
01:57:55,112 -- 01:57:56,238
Luke.

1415
01:57:56,614 -- 01:57:57,907
Father.

1416
01:57:59,492 -- 01:58:01,827
Son, come with me.

1417
01:58:04,622 -- 01:58:06,040
Ben.

1418
01:58:07,041 -- 01:58:09,043
Why didn't you tell me?

1419
01:58:15,424 -- 01:58:16,425
Chewie!

1420
01:58:27,603 -- 01:58:28,854
It's Vader.

1421
01:58:34,652 -- 01:58:38,030
Luke, it is your destiny.

1422
01:58:42,868 -- 01:58:44,078
Ben.

1423
01:58:45,663 -- 01:58:47,498
Why didn't you tell me?

1424
01:58:54,380 -- 01:58:56,215
Alert all commands.

1425
01:58:56,590 -- 01:58:58,175
Ready for the tractor beam.

1426
01:59:01,220 -- 01:59:02,805
R2, come back at once!

1427
01:59:02,888 -- 01:59:04,807
You haven't finished with me yet.

1428
01:59:04,890 -- 01:59:06,684
You don't know
how to fix the hyperdrive.

1429
01:59:06,767 -- 01:59:08,060
Chewbacca can do it.

1430
01:59:08,143 -- 01:59:09,687
I'm standing here in pieces,

1431
01:59:09,770 -- 01:59:12,231
and you're having delusions of grandeur!

1432
01:59:16,110 -- 01:59:17,361
You did it!

1433
02:00:14,835 -- 02:00:16,921
Luke, we're ready for take-off.

1434
02:00:17,004 -- 02:00:18,213
iGood luck, Lando./i

1435
02:00:19,298 -- 02:00:21,508
iWhen we find Jabba the Hutt
and that bounty hunter,/i

1436
02:00:21,592 -- 02:00:22,801
iwe'll contact you./i

1437
02:00:23,302 -- 02:00:26,013
I'll meet you
at the rendezvous point on Tatooine.

1438
02:00:26,096 -- 02:00:28,140
Princess, we'll find Han.

1439
02:00:28,390 -- 02:00:29,642
I promise.

1440
02:00:29,725 -- 02:00:31,685
Chewie,
I'll be waiting for your signal.

1441
02:00:31,977 -- 02:00:33,771
Take care, you two.

1442
02:00:33,854 -- 02:00:35,731
iMay the Force be with you./i

1443
02:00:35,814 -- 02:00:37,232
Gahhh.

1444
02:00:37,316 -- 02:00:39,944
iGahhh./i

1445
02:00:48,994 -- 02:00:49,995
Ow.

Did you hear that?

3
00:02:49,683 -- 00:02:52,936
They shut down the main reactor.
We'll be destroyed for sure.

4
00:02:53,019 -- 00:02:54,187
This is madness.

5
00:03:04,656 -- 00:03:06,449
We're doomed.

6
00:03:08,159 -- 00:03:10,245
There'll be no escape
for the princess this time.

7
00:03:13,373 -- 00:03:14,874
What's that?

8
00:04:57,435 -- 00:04:59,938
R2-D2, where are you?

9
00:05:16,287 -- 00:05:18,832
At last. Where have you been?

10
00:05:18,915 -- 00:05:22,043
They're heading in this direction.
What are we going to do?

11
00:05:22,127 -- 00:05:26,673
We'll be sent to the spice mines of
Kessel or smashed into who knows what.

12
00:05:26,756 -- 00:05:29,384
Wait a minute. Where are you going?

13
00:05:41,771 -- 00:05:44,399
The Death Star plans
are not in the main computer.

14
00:05:44,941 -- 00:05:47,152
Where are those transmissions
you intercepted?

15
00:05:47,610 -- 00:05:50,029
What have you done with those plans?

16
00:05:50,280 -- 00:05:52,740
We intercepted
no transmissions.

17
00:05:53,116 -- 00:05:57,078
This is a consular ship.
We're on a diplomatic mission.

18
00:05:57,328 -- 00:06:01,708
If this is a consular ship,
where is the ambassador?

19
00:06:05,336 -- 00:06:08,756
Commander, tear this ship apart
until you've found those plans!

20
00:06:08,840 -- 00:06:11,718
And bring me the passengers!
I want them alive!

21
00:06:24,439 -- 00:06:25,815
There's one. Set for stun.

22
00:06:31,696 -- 00:06:33,031
She'll be all right.

23
00:06:33,114 -- 00:06:35,200
Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.

24
00:06:36,743 -- 00:06:39,454
Hey. You're not permitted in there.
It's restricted.

25
00:06:39,537 -- 00:06:41,206
You'll be deactivated for sure.

26
00:06:43,333 -- 00:06:46,252
Don't call me a mindless philosopher,
you overweight glob of grease.

27
00:06:46,336 -- 00:06:47,921
Come out, before somebody sees you.

28
00:06:50,048 -- 00:06:52,258
Secret mission? What plans?

29
00:06:52,342 -- 00:06:54,969
What are you talking about?
I'm not getting in there.

30
00:06:58,181 -- 00:06:59,515
I'm going to regret this.

31
00:07:07,732 -- 00:07:11,110
- There goes another one.
- Hold your fire. There's no life-forms.

32
00:07:11,194 -- 00:07:12,487
It must have short-circuited.

33
00:07:12,570 -- 00:07:16,532
That's funny. The damage
doesn't look as bad from out here.

34
00:07:18,201 -- 00:07:20,203
Are you sure this thing is safe?

35
00:07:39,138 -- 00:07:41,683
Darth Vader. Only you could be so bold.

36
00:07:41,766 -- 00:07:44,018
The Imperial Senate
will not sit still for this.

37
00:07:44,102 -- 00:07:45,728
When they hear you've attacked...

38
00:07:45,812 -- 00:07:47,563
Don't act so surprised, Your Highness.

39
00:07:47,647 -- 00:07:49,941
You weren't on
any mercy mission this time.

40
00:07:50,024 -- 00:07:53,778
Several transmissions were beamed
to this ship by rebel spies.

41
00:07:53,861 -- 00:07:56,739
I want to know what happened
to the plans they sent you.

42
00:07:56,948 -- 00:07:58,783
I don't know what you're talking about.

43
00:07:58,866 -- 00:08:01,953
I'm a member of the Imperial Senate
on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan.

44
00:08:02,036 -- 00:08:04,914
You are part of the Rebel Alliance
and a traitor.

45
00:08:05,456 -- 00:08:07,417
Take her away!

46
00:08:11,170 -- 00:08:12,547
Holding her is dangerous.

47
00:08:12,630 -- 00:08:14,382
If word of this gets out,
it could generate

48
00:08:14,465 -- 00:08:16,175
sympathy for the rebellion
in the senate.

49
00:08:16,259 -- 00:08:18,928
I have traced the rebel spies to her.

50
00:08:19,012 -- 00:08:21,806
Now she is my only link
to finding their secret base.

51
00:08:21,889 -- 00:08:23,683
She'll die before
she'll tell you anything.

52
00:08:23,766 -- 00:08:25,351
Leave that to me.

53
00:08:25,435 -- 00:08:28,938
Send a distress signal, and then inform
the senate that all aboard were killed.

54
00:08:29,022 -- 00:08:32,233
Lord Vader, the battle station plans
are not aboard this ship

55
00:08:32,317 -- 00:08:33,776
and no transmissions were made.

56
00:08:34,277 -- 00:08:36,404
An escape pod was jettisoned
during the fighting,

57
00:08:36,487 -- 00:08:37,947
but no life-forms were aboard.

58
00:08:38,614 -- 00:08:41,159
She must have hidden
the plans in the escape pod.

59
00:08:41,242 -- 00:08:43,119
Send a detachment
down to retrieve them.

60
00:08:43,202 -- 00:08:44,871
See to it personally, Commander.

61
00:08:44,954 -- 00:08:46,873
There'll be no one to stop us this time.

62
00:08:46,956 -- 00:08:48,541
Yes, sir.

63
00:09:03,139 -- 00:09:05,141
How did we get into this mess?

64
00:09:05,224 -- 00:09:07,685
I really don't know how.

65
00:09:08,227 -- 00:09:12,190
We seem to be made to suffer.
It's our lot in life.

66
00:09:14,275 -- 00:09:18,488
I've got to rest before I fall apart.
My joints are almost frozen.

67
00:09:24,786 -- 00:09:26,954
What a desolate place this is.

68
00:09:31,584 -- 00:09:33,169
Where do you think you're going?

69
00:09:33,252 -- 00:09:34,754
Well, I'm not going that way.

70
00:09:35,505 -- 00:09:37,465
It's much too rocky.

71
00:09:37,548 -- 00:09:39,467
This way is much easier.

72
00:09:39,550 -- 00:09:42,011
What makes you think
there are settlements over there?

73
00:09:43,971 -- 00:09:45,515
Don't get technical with me.

74
00:09:46,766 -- 00:09:48,851
What mission?
What are you talking about?

75
00:09:51,062 -- 00:09:53,940
I've just about had enough of you.

76
00:09:54,023 -- 00:09:55,274
Go that way.

77
00:09:55,358 -- 00:09:59,070
You'll be malfunctioning within a day,
you nearsighted scrap pile.

78
00:09:59,152 -- 00:10:01,215
And don't let me catch you
following me, begging for help

79
00:10:01,240 -- 00:10:03,074
because you won't get it.

80
00:10:17,046 -- 00:10:18,548
No more adventures.

81
00:10:18,631 -- 00:10:20,716
I'm not going that way.

82
00:10:54,750 -- 00:10:57,753
That malfunctioning little twerp.
This is all his fault.

83
00:10:58,754 -- 00:11:00,840
He tricked me into going this way,

84
00:11:00,923 -- 00:11:02,842
but he'll do no better.

85
00:11:06,429 -- 00:11:08,347
Wait. What's that?

86
00:11:08,431 -- 00:11:11,225
A transport. I'm saved.

87
00:11:11,309 -- 00:11:13,019
Over here!

88
00:11:13,102 -- 00:11:15,688
Hey! Hey!

89
00:11:15,771 -- 00:11:19,275
Help! Please help!

90
00:14:50,403 -- 00:14:51,404
R2?

91
00:14:55,074 -- 00:14:58,911
R2-D2, it is you! It is you!

92
00:15:32,403 -- 00:15:36,365
Someone was in the pod.
The tracks go off in this direction.

93
00:15:36,449 -- 00:15:38,367
Look, sir. Droids.

94
00:15:53,132 -- 00:15:54,383
We stopped.

95
00:15:54,467 -- 00:15:56,218
Wake up. Wake up!

96
00:16:03,142 -- 00:16:04,810
We're doomed.

97
00:16:13,068 -- 00:16:14,653
Do you think they'll melt us down?

98
00:16:27,917 -- 00:16:30,085
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

99
00:16:30,169 -- 00:16:32,338
Will this never end?

100
00:17:11,710 -- 00:17:14,505
- Fine. Let's go.
- Luke!

101
00:17:14,588 -- 00:17:16,090
Luke!

102
00:17:19,635 -- 00:17:24,640
Luke, tell your uncle if he gets
a translator, be sure it speaks Bocce.

103
00:17:24,723 -- 00:17:27,226
Doesn't look like we have much choice,
but I'll remind him.

104
00:17:37,319 -- 00:17:40,489
Yeah, we'll take that red one.

105
00:17:40,573 -- 00:17:42,575
No, not that one.

106
00:17:44,326 -- 00:17:47,371
You. I suppose you're programmed
for etiquette and protocol.

107
00:17:47,454 -- 00:17:50,207
Protocol?
Why, it's my primary function, sir.

108
00:17:50,291 -- 00:17:51,959
I am well versed in all the customs...

109
00:17:52,042 -- 00:17:54,879
- I have no need for a protocol droid.
- Of course you haven't, sir.

110
00:17:54,962 -- 00:17:57,965
Not in an environment such as this.
That's why I have been programmed...

111
00:17:58,048 -- 00:17:59,717
What I need is a droid who understands

112
00:17:59,800 -- 00:18:01,760
the binary language
of moisture vaporators.

113
00:18:01,844 -- 00:18:05,180
Vaporators? Sir, my first job
was programming binary load lifters,

114
00:18:05,264 -- 00:18:07,391
very similar to your vaporators
in most respects.

115
00:18:07,474 -- 00:18:08,475
Can you speak Bocce?

116
00:18:08,559 -- 00:18:10,978
Of course I can, sir.
It's like a second language to me.

117
00:18:11,061 -- 00:18:13,480
- All right. Shut up. I'll take this one.
- Shutting up, sir.

118
00:18:13,564 -- 00:18:14,732
Luke!

119
00:18:16,483 -- 00:18:18,277
Take these two over
to the garage, will you?

120
00:18:18,360 -- 00:18:19,904
I want them cleaned up before dinner.

121
00:18:19,987 -- 00:18:22,740
But I was going into Tosche Station
to pick up some power converters.

122
00:18:22,823 -- 00:18:25,409
You can waste time with your friends
when your chores are done.

123
00:18:25,492 -- 00:18:26,952
Now come on. Get to it.

124
00:18:28,787 -- 00:18:30,039
All right. Come on.

125
00:18:32,791 -- 00:18:35,169
And the red one. Come on.

126
00:18:35,252 -- 00:18:37,922
Well, come on, red. Let's go.

127
00:18:57,524 -- 00:18:59,526
- Uncle Owen.
- Yeah?

128
00:18:59,610 -- 00:19:02,321
This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look.

129
00:19:02,696 -- 00:19:04,823
Hey, what are you trying to push on us?

130
00:19:07,826 -- 00:19:12,748
Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit
is in prime condition, a real bargain.

131
00:19:12,831 -- 00:19:15,417
- Uncle Owen? What about that one?
- Yeah?

132
00:19:15,501 -- 00:19:18,712
What about that blue one?
We'll take that one.

133
00:19:18,837 -- 00:19:19,964
Take this away.

134
00:19:20,047 -- 00:19:21,590
You'll be pleased with that one, sir.

135
00:19:21,674 -- 00:19:25,094
He really is in first-class condition.
I've worked with him before.

136
00:19:25,177 -- 00:19:26,679
Here he comes.

137
00:19:29,890 -- 00:19:31,600
Okay. Let's go.

138
00:19:31,684 -- 00:19:33,143
Now, don't you forget this.

139
00:19:33,227 -- 00:19:36,730
Why I should stick my neck out for you
is quite beyond my capacity.

140
00:19:42,903 -- 00:19:46,240
Thank the maker.
This oil bath is going to feel so good.

141
00:19:47,700 -- 00:19:51,286
I've got such a bad case of
dust contamination, I can barely move.

142
00:19:51,370 -- 00:19:52,955
It just isn't fair.

143
00:19:53,038 -- 00:19:56,166
Biggs is right.
I'm never gonna get out of here.

144
00:19:56,250 -- 00:19:58,460
Is there anything I might do to help?

145
00:19:58,544 -- 00:20:01,964
No, not unless you can alter time,
speed up the harvest,

146
00:20:02,047 -- 00:20:03,507
or teleport me off this rock.

147
00:20:03,590 -- 00:20:05,134
I don't think so, sir.

148
00:20:05,217 -- 00:20:08,303
I'm only a droid and not very
knowledgeable about such things.

149
00:20:08,387 -- 00:20:10,305
Not on this planet, anyway.

150
00:20:10,389 -- 00:20:13,809
As a matter of fact,
I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.

151
00:20:13,892 -- 00:20:15,978
Well, if there's a bright centre
to the universe,

152
00:20:16,061 -- 00:20:18,313
you're on the planet
that it's farthest from.

153
00:20:18,397 -- 00:20:20,816
I see, sir.

154
00:20:20,899 -- 00:20:23,736
- You can call me Luke.
- I see, Sir Luke.

155
00:20:24,028 -- 00:20:26,321
Just Luke.

156
00:20:26,989 -- 00:20:30,159
And I am C-3PO,
human-cyborg relations.

157
00:20:30,242 -- 00:20:32,911
And this is my counterpart, R2-D2.

158
00:20:32,995 -- 00:20:34,288
Hello.

159
00:20:35,622 -- 00:20:37,291
You got a lot of carbon scoring here.

160
00:20:37,374 -- 00:20:39,251
Looks like you boys
have seen a lot of action.

161
00:20:39,334 -- 00:20:40,502
With all we've been through,

162
00:20:40,586 -- 00:20:42,963
sometimes I'm amazed
we're in as good condition as we are,

163
00:20:43,047 -- 00:20:44,381
what with the rebellion and all.

164
00:20:44,465 -- 00:20:46,425
You know of the rebellion
against the Empire?

165
00:20:46,508 -- 00:20:48,177
That's how we came to be
in your service,

166
00:20:48,260 -- 00:20:50,095
if you take my meaning, sir.

167
00:20:50,179 -- 00:20:52,514
- Have you been in many battles?
- Several, I think.

168
00:20:52,598 -- 00:20:54,516
Actually, there's not much to tell.

169
00:20:54,600 -- 00:20:58,270
I'm not much more than an interpreter
and not very good at telling stories.

170
00:20:58,353 -- 00:21:01,440
Well, not at making them
interesting, anyway.

171
00:21:01,523 -- 00:21:03,442
Well, my little friend,

172
00:21:03,525 -- 00:21:05,611
you got something jammed
in here real good.

173
00:21:05,694 -- 00:21:07,196
Were you on a Starcruiser or...

174
00:21:08,030 -- 00:21:11,116
iHelp me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope./i

175
00:21:11,200 -- 00:21:12,868
What's this?

176
00:21:12,951 -- 00:21:16,080
What is what?
He asked you a question. What is that?

177
00:21:16,163 -- 00:21:20,125
iHelp me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope./i

178
00:21:23,504 -- 00:21:27,466
iHelp me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope./i

179
00:21:29,968 -- 00:21:32,137
Oh. He says it's nothing, sir,
merely a malfunction.

180
00:21:32,221 -- 00:21:34,098
Old data. Pay it no mind.

181
00:21:34,181 -- 00:21:36,558
Who is she? She's beautiful.

182
00:21:36,642 -- 00:21:40,062
I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.

183
00:21:40,145 -- 00:21:42,356
I think she was a passenger
on our last voyage.

184
00:21:42,439 -- 00:21:44,441
A person of some importance, I believe.

185
00:21:44,525 -- 00:21:46,902
- Our captain was...
- Is there any more to this recording?

186
00:21:49,071 -- 00:21:52,241
Behave yourself, R2.
You're going to get us into trouble.

187
00:21:52,324 -- 00:21:55,077
It's all right. You can trust him.
He's our new master.

188
00:21:55,160 -- 00:21:56,829
iYou're my only hope./i

189
00:21:58,205 -- 00:22:01,250
He says he's the property
of Obi-Wan Kenobi,

190
00:22:01,333 -- 00:22:02,876
a resident of these parts,

191
00:22:02,960 -- 00:22:04,670
and it's a private message for him.

192
00:22:04,753 -- 00:22:07,089
Quite frankly, sir, I don't know
what he's talking about.

193
00:22:07,172 -- 00:22:08,924
Our last master was Captain Antilles.

194
00:22:09,007 -- 00:22:10,676
But with all we've been through,

195
00:22:10,759 -- 00:22:13,595
this little R2 unit
has become a bit eccentric.

196
00:22:14,138 -- 00:22:17,057
Obi-Wan Kenobi.
I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi.

197
00:22:17,141 -- 00:22:19,852
I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know
what he's talking about?

198
00:22:19,935 -- 00:22:22,396
I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan,

199
00:22:23,021 -- 00:22:25,149
but old Ben lives out
beyond the Dune Sea.

200
00:22:25,232 -- 00:22:27,067
He's kind of a strange old hermit.

201
00:22:28,235 -- 00:22:30,237
I wonder who she is.

202
00:22:30,320 -- 00:22:33,365
Sounds like she's in trouble.
I better play back the whole thing.

203
00:22:36,869 -- 00:22:40,289
He says the restraining bolt has
short-circuited his recording system.

204
00:22:40,706 -- 00:22:42,749
He suggests that if you remove the bolt,

205
00:22:42,833 -- 00:22:45,752
he might be able to play back
the entire recording.

206
00:22:45,836 -- 00:22:48,172
Oh, yeah. Well...

207
00:22:48,255 -- 00:22:51,800
I guess you're too small
to run away on me if I take this off.

208
00:22:51,884 -- 00:22:53,051
Okay.

209
00:22:55,804 -- 00:22:57,431
There you go.

210
00:22:59,099 -- 00:23:02,644
Wait a minute. Where'd she go? Bring her
back. Play back the entire message.

211
00:23:02,728 -- 00:23:03,729
What message?

212
00:23:04,521 -- 00:23:05,981
The one you've just been playing.

213
00:23:06,064 -- 00:23:08,192
The one you're carrying
inside your rusty innards.

214
00:23:08,275 -- 00:23:10,652
Luke! Luke!

215
00:23:10,736 -- 00:23:12,946
I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.

216
00:23:13,071 -- 00:23:16,200
I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have
picked up a slight flutter.

217
00:23:16,283 -- 00:23:19,745
Here. See what you can do with him.
I'll be right back.

218
00:23:22,414 -- 00:23:24,917
Just you reconsider
playing that message for him.

219
00:23:26,418 -- 00:23:28,754
No, I don't think he likes you at all.

220
00:23:28,837 -- 00:23:31,089
No, I don't like you either.

221
00:23:39,932 -- 00:23:42,684
You know, I think that R2 unit we bought
might have been stolen.

222
00:23:42,768 -- 00:23:43,852
What makes you think that?

223
00:23:43,936 -- 00:23:46,563
I stumbled across a recording
while I was cleaning him.

224
00:23:46,647 -- 00:23:49,399
He says he belongs to someone
called Obi-Wan Kenobi.

225
00:23:51,985 -- 00:23:55,322
I thought he might have meant old Ben.
Do you know what he's talking about?

226
00:23:58,075 -- 00:23:59,618
I wonder if he's related to Ben.

227
00:23:59,701 -- 00:24:01,495
That wizard's just a crazy old man.

228
00:24:02,663 -- 00:24:04,957
Tomorrow, I want you to take
that R2 unit to Anchorhead

229
00:24:05,040 -- 00:24:06,458
and have its memory erased.

230
00:24:06,541 -- 00:24:08,710
That'll be the end of it.
It belongs to us now.

231
00:24:10,462 -- 00:24:13,507
But what if this Obi-Wan
comes looking for him?

232
00:24:13,590 -- 00:24:15,342
He won't.

233
00:24:15,425 -- 00:24:17,386
I don't think he exists any more.

234
00:24:17,469 -- 00:24:19,304
He died about the same time
as your father.

235
00:24:19,680 -- 00:24:22,391
- He knew my father?
- I told you to forget it.

236
00:24:23,517 -- 00:24:27,104
Your only concern is to prepare
those new droids for tomorrow.

237
00:24:27,187 -- 00:24:29,523
In the morning,
I want them up there on the south ridge,

238
00:24:29,606 -- 00:24:30,899
working on those condensers.

239
00:24:30,983 -- 00:24:32,484
Yes, sir.

240
00:24:33,860 -- 00:24:36,405
I think those new droids
are gonna work out fine.

241
00:24:36,488 -- 00:24:40,075
In fact, I was also thinking
about our agreement,

242
00:24:40,158 -- 00:24:41,910
about me staying on another season.

243
00:24:43,912 -- 00:24:45,455
And if these new droids do work out,

244
00:24:45,539 -- 00:24:48,041
I want to transmit my application
to the academy this year.

245
00:24:48,542 -- 00:24:50,502
You mean the next semester
before the harvest?

246
00:24:50,585 -- 00:24:52,504
Sure. There's more than enough droids.

247
00:24:52,587 -- 00:24:54,589
Harvest is when I need you the most.

248
00:24:54,673 -- 00:24:56,675
It's only one season more.

249
00:24:56,758 -- 00:24:58,468
This year we'll make enough
on the harvest

250
00:24:58,552 -- 00:25:00,304
that I'll be able to hire
some more hands

251
00:25:00,387 -- 00:25:02,347
and then you can go
to the academy next year.

252
00:25:03,265 -- 00:25:05,267
You must understand
I need you here, Luke.

253
00:25:05,350 -- 00:25:08,270
- But it's a whole 'nother year.
- It's only one more season.

254
00:25:08,353 -- 00:25:10,439
That's what you said
when Biggs and Tank left.

255
00:25:10,522 -- 00:25:12,983
- Where are you going?
- Looks like I'm going nowhere.

256
00:25:13,066 -- 00:25:14,943
I have to go finish
cleaning those droids.

257
00:25:15,027 -- 00:25:18,447
Owen, he can't stay here forever.
Most of his friends have gone.

258
00:25:18,739 -- 00:25:20,949
It means so much to him.

259
00:25:21,033 -- 00:25:23,577
I'll make it up to him next year.
I promise.

260
00:25:25,245 -- 00:25:29,249
Luke's just not a farmer, Owen.
He has too much of his father in him.

261
00:25:29,708 -- 00:25:31,501
That's what I'm afraid of.

262
00:26:20,717 -- 00:26:23,845
- What are you doing hiding back there?
- It wasn't my fault, sir.

263
00:26:23,929 -- 00:26:25,680
Please don't deactivate me.

264
00:26:25,764 -- 00:26:28,517
I told him not to go,
but he's faulty, malfunctioning.

265
00:26:28,600 -- 00:26:31,853
- Kept babbling on about his mission.
- Oh, no.

266
00:26:40,278 -- 00:26:42,697
That R2 unit has
always been a problem.

267
00:26:43,115 -- 00:26:45,367
These astro droids
are getting quite out of hand.

268
00:26:45,450 -- 00:26:47,661
Even I can't understand
their logic at times.

269
00:26:47,744 -- 00:26:50,455
How could I be so stupid?
He's nowhere in sight.

270
00:26:50,914 -- 00:26:51,915
Blast it!

271
00:26:51,998 -- 00:26:54,251
Pardon me, sir,
but couldn't we go after him?

272
00:26:54,334 -- 00:26:56,211
It's too dangerous
with the Sandpeople around.

273
00:26:56,294 -- 00:26:57,504
We'll have to wait till morning.

274
00:26:57,629 -- 00:26:59,589
Luke, I'm shutting the power down.

275
00:26:59,673 -- 00:27:02,217
All right.
I'll be there in a few minutes.

276
00:27:02,300 -- 00:27:04,719
Boy, am I gonna get it.

277
00:27:04,803 -- 00:27:06,596
You know, that little droid's gonna
cause me a lot of trouble.

278
00:27:06,680 -- 00:27:08,515
Oh, he excels at that, sir.

279
00:27:08,598 -- 00:27:11,101
Come on.

280
00:27:19,651 -- 00:27:20,986
Luke?

281
00:27:22,112 -- 00:27:23,238
Luke?

282
00:27:24,322 -- 00:27:25,490
Luke!

283
00:27:31,663 -- 00:27:33,582
Have you seen Luke this morning?

284
00:27:33,665 -- 00:27:37,085
He said he had some things to do before
he started today, so he left early.

285
00:27:37,169 -- 00:27:40,797
- Did he take those new droids with him?
- I think so.

286
00:27:40,881 -- 00:27:43,758
He better have those units in
the south range repaired by midday

287
00:27:43,842 -- 00:27:45,385
or there'll be hell to pay.

288
00:27:46,511 -- 00:27:49,097
There's a droid on the scanner.
Dead ahead.

289
00:27:49,181 -- 00:27:52,184
It might be our little R2 unit.
Hit the accelerator.

290
00:28:14,331 -- 00:28:16,416
Hey, whoa!
Just where do you think you're going?

291
00:28:16,500 -- 00:28:19,461
Master Luke is your rightful owner now.

292
00:28:19,544 -- 00:28:22,547
We'll have no more
of this Obi-Wan Kenobi gibberish.

293
00:28:23,798 -- 00:28:25,467
Don't talk to me of your mission either.

294
00:28:25,550 -- 00:28:28,637
You're fortunate he doesn't blast you
into a million pieces right here.

295
00:28:28,720 -- 00:28:31,598
No. It's all right,
but I think we'd better go.

296
00:28:31,681 -- 00:28:33,975
What's wrong with him now?

297
00:28:34,267 -- 00:28:37,145
There are several creatures
approaching from the southeast.

298
00:28:37,229 -- 00:28:39,689
Sandpeople. Or worse.

299
00:28:41,066 -- 00:28:42,651
Come on. Let's go have a look.

300
00:28:42,734 -- 00:28:43,860
Come on.

301
00:28:46,571 -- 00:28:50,325
Well, there are two Banthas down there,
but I don't see any...

302
00:28:50,408 -- 00:28:52,202
Wait a second.

303
00:28:52,285 -- 00:28:54,746
They're Sandpeople, all right.
I can see one of them now.

304
00:30:09,821 -- 00:30:10,989
Hello there.

305
00:30:13,658 -- 00:30:17,329
Come here, my little friend.
Don't be afraid.

306
00:30:19,539 -- 00:30:21,166
Don't worry. He'll be all right.

307
00:30:27,339 -- 00:30:29,841
Rest easy, son. You've had a busy day.

308
00:30:30,675 -- 00:30:33,595
You're fortunate to be all in one piece.

309
00:30:36,890 -- 00:30:39,142
Ben? Ben Kenobi?

310
00:30:39,225 -- 00:30:41,269
Boy, am I glad to see you.

311
00:30:41,353 -- 00:30:44,397
The Jundland Wastes
are not to be travelled lightly.

312
00:30:47,525 -- 00:30:51,696
Tell me, young Luke,
what brings you out this far?

313
00:30:51,780 -- 00:30:53,323
This little droid.

314
00:30:55,033 -- 00:30:57,035
I think he's searching
for his former master,

315
00:30:57,118 -- 00:30:59,329
but I've never seen
such devotion in a droid before.

316
00:31:01,289 -- 00:31:04,376
He claims to be the property
of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.

317
00:31:04,459 -- 00:31:07,087
Is he a relative of yours?
Do you know who he's talking about?

318
00:31:08,630 -- 00:31:10,215
Obi-Wan Kenobi?

319
00:31:12,717 -- 00:31:14,636
Obi-Wan.

320
00:31:15,095 -- 00:31:19,307
Now, that's a name
I've not heard in a long time.

321
00:31:19,891 -- 00:31:21,726
A long time.

322
00:31:22,894 -- 00:31:25,814
I think my uncle knows him.
He said he was dead.

323
00:31:25,897 -- 00:31:27,732
Oh, he's not dead.

324
00:31:27,816 -- 00:31:28,942
Not yet.

325
00:31:29,359 -- 00:31:32,529
- You know him?
- Well, of course I know him.

326
00:31:32,612 -- 00:31:33,988
He's me.

327
00:31:36,116 -- 00:31:39,452
I haven't gone by the name of Obi-Wan

328
00:31:39,536 -- 00:31:42,163
since, oh, before you were born.

329
00:31:42,247 -- 00:31:43,915
Well, then the droid does belong to you.

330
00:31:44,290 -- 00:31:46,626
I don't seem to remember
ever owning a droid.

331
00:31:48,878 -- 00:31:50,630
Very interesting.

332
00:31:51,965 -- 00:31:54,509
I think we better get indoors.

333
00:31:54,592 -- 00:31:57,262
The Sandpeople are easily startled,

334
00:31:57,345 -- 00:32:00,181
but they'll soon be back,
and in greater numbers.

335
00:32:03,143 -- 00:32:04,436
3PO.

336
00:32:13,778 -- 00:32:16,448
Where am I?
I must have taken a bad step.

337
00:32:17,991 -- 00:32:21,202
Can you stand? We've gotta get out
of here before the Sandpeople return.

338
00:32:21,286 -- 00:32:23,997
I don't think I can make it.
You go on, Master Luke.

339
00:32:24,122 -- 00:32:28,209
There's no sense in you risking yourself
on my account. I'm done for.

340
00:32:29,169 -- 00:32:31,087
No, you're not.
What kind of talk is that?

341
00:32:31,171 -- 00:32:33,131
Quickly. They're on the move.

342
00:32:38,386 -- 00:32:41,765
My father didn't fight in the wars.
He was a navigator on a spice freighter.

343
00:32:41,848 -- 00:32:43,683
That's what your uncle told you.

344
00:32:43,767 -- 00:32:45,602
He didn't hold
with your father's ideals.

345
00:32:45,685 -- 00:32:48,813
Thought he should have stayed here
and not gotten involved.

346
00:32:49,522 -- 00:32:51,900
- You fought in the Clone Wars?
- Yes.

347
00:32:52,358 -- 00:32:56,029
I was once a Jedi knight,
the same as your father.

348
00:32:58,406 -- 00:32:59,741
I wish I'd known him.

349
00:32:59,824 -- 00:33:02,577
He was the best starpilot in the galaxy

350
00:33:03,661 -- 00:33:05,497
and a cunning warrior.

351
00:33:05,580 -- 00:33:08,500
I understand you've become
quite a good pilot yourself.

352
00:33:10,376 -- 00:33:12,670
And he was a good friend.

353
00:33:13,338 -- 00:33:14,464
Which reminds me...

354
00:33:15,548 -- 00:33:17,550
I have something here for you.

355
00:33:19,677 -- 00:33:22,263
Your father wanted you to have this
when you were old enough,

356
00:33:22,764 -- 00:33:24,891
but your uncle wouldn't allow it.

357
00:33:25,850 -- 00:33:27,977
He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan

358
00:33:28,061 -- 00:33:31,564
on some damn-fool idealistic crusade,
like your father did.

359
00:33:31,648 -- 00:33:34,526
Sir, if you'll not be needing me,
I'll close down for a while.

360
00:33:34,609 -- 00:33:36,194
Sure. Go ahead.

361
00:33:38,863 -- 00:33:42,283
- What is it?
- Your father's lightsaber.

362
00:33:43,034 -- 00:33:44,702
This is the weapon of a Jedi knight.

363
00:33:45,745 -- 00:33:48,915
Not as clumsy or random as a blaster.

364
00:33:49,582 -- 00:33:51,835
An elegant weapon

365
00:33:51,918 -- 00:33:54,921
for a more civilised age.

366
00:33:56,798 -- 00:33:59,175
For over a thousand generations,
the Jedi knights

367
00:33:59,259 -- 00:34:03,346
were the guardians of
peace and justice in the old Republic

368
00:34:03,847 -- 00:34:06,266
before the dark times,

369
00:34:06,349 -- 00:34:07,892
before the Empire.

370
00:34:11,104 -- 00:34:12,814
How did my father die?

371
00:34:15,275 -- 00:34:17,819
A young Jedi named Darth Vader,

372
00:34:17,902 -- 00:34:20,405
who was a pupil of mine
until he turned to evil,

373
00:34:21,239 -- 00:34:24,576
helped the Empire hunt down
and destroy the Jedi knights.

374
00:34:26,411 -- 00:34:28,830
He betrayed and murdered your father.

375
00:34:30,582 -- 00:34:32,917
Now the Jedi are all but extinct.

376
00:34:34,085 -- 00:34:37,881
Vader was seduced
by the dark side of the Force.

377
00:34:38,673 -- 00:34:40,717
The Force?

378
00:34:40,800 -- 00:34:43,845
The Force is
what gives a Jedi his power.

379
00:34:43,928 -- 00:34:46,514
It's an energy field
created by all living things.

380
00:34:46,598 -- 00:34:49,142
It surrounds us and penetrates us.

381
00:34:49,267 -- 00:34:51,352
It binds the galaxy together.

382
00:34:58,318 -- 00:35:01,404
Now, let's see if we can't figure out
what you are, my little friend,

383
00:35:02,155 -- 00:35:04,240
and where you come from.

384
00:35:04,324 -- 00:35:07,535
- I saw part of a message...
- I seem to have found it.

385
00:35:07,619 -- 00:35:11,956
iGeneral Kenobi, years ago you served
my father in the Clone Wars./i

386
00:35:12,332 -- 00:35:15,460
iNow he begs you to help him
in his struggle against the Empire./i

387
00:35:15,543 -- 00:35:18,880
iI regret that I am unable to present
my father's request in person./i

388
00:35:18,963 -- 00:35:20,632
iBut my ship has fallen under attack/i

389
00:35:20,715 -- 00:35:23,384
iand I'm afraid my mission
to bring you to Alderaan has failed./i

390
00:35:23,468 -- 00:35:26,554
iI have placed information
vital to the survival of the rebellion/i

391
00:35:26,638 -- 00:35:28,848
iinto the memory systems
of this R2 unit./i

392
00:35:28,932 -- 00:35:30,850
iMy father will know how to retrieve it./i

393
00:35:31,309 -- 00:35:35,063
iYou must see this droid
safely delivered to him on Alderaan./i

394
00:35:35,146 -- 00:35:36,814
iThis is our most desperate hour./i

395
00:35:37,565 -- 00:35:40,860
iHelp me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope./i

396
00:35:55,833 -- 00:36:00,004
You must learn the ways of the Force
if you're to come with me to Alderaan.

397
00:36:00,713 -- 00:36:02,090
Alderaan?

398
00:36:02,173 -- 00:36:03,424
I'm not going to Alderaan.

399
00:36:03,508 -- 00:36:05,927
I've gotta get home.
It's late. I'm in for it as it is.

400
00:36:06,010 -- 00:36:08,471
I need your help, Luke.
She needs your help.

401
00:36:08,972 -- 00:36:11,641
I'm getting too old
for this sort of thing.

402
00:36:16,229 -- 00:36:19,607
I can't get involved.
I've got work to do.

403
00:36:20,400 -- 00:36:22,276
It's not that I like the Empire.
I hate it.

404
00:36:22,360 -- 00:36:24,946
But there's nothing
I can do about it right now.

405
00:36:26,406 -- 00:36:30,034
- It's all such a long way from here.
- That's your uncle talking.

406
00:36:30,243 -- 00:36:33,955
Oh, boy. My uncle.
How am I ever gonna explain this?

407
00:36:34,038 -- 00:36:35,748
Learn about the Force, Luke.

408
00:36:42,880 -- 00:36:45,633
Look, I can take you
as far as Anchorhead.

409
00:36:45,717 -- 00:36:49,053
You can get a transport there
to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.

410
00:36:50,388 -- 00:36:53,391
You must do what you feel
is right, of course.

411
00:37:00,940 -- 00:37:04,569
Until this battle station is fully
operational, we are vulnerable.

412
00:37:04,652 -- 00:37:07,113
The Rebel Alliance
is too well equipped.

413
00:37:07,196 -- 00:37:08,865
They're more dangerous
than you realise.

414
00:37:08,948 -- 00:37:11,826
Dangerous to your starfleet,
Commander,

415
00:37:11,909 -- 00:37:13,661
not to this battle station.

416
00:37:13,745 -- 00:37:17,331
The rebellion will continue to
gain support in the Imperial Senate...

417
00:37:17,415 -- 00:37:21,753
The Imperial Senate will no longer
be of any concern to us.

418
00:37:21,836 -- 00:37:26,007
I've just received word that the Emperor
has dissolved the council permanently.

419
00:37:26,090 -- 00:37:30,094
The last remnants of the old Republic
have been swept away.

420
00:37:30,178 -- 00:37:31,846
That's impossible.

421
00:37:31,929 -- 00:37:34,557
How will the Emperor maintain control
without the bureaucracy?

422
00:37:34,640 -- 00:37:39,437
The regional governors now have
direct control over their territories.

423
00:37:39,520 -- 00:37:43,274
Fear will keep
the local systems in line.

424
00:37:43,399 -- 00:37:45,485
Fear of this battle station.

425
00:37:45,568 -- 00:37:46,694
And what of the rebellion?

426
00:37:46,778 -- 00:37:50,031
If the rebels have obtained a complete
technical readout of this station,

427
00:37:50,114 -- 00:37:52,033
it is possible, however unlikely,

428
00:37:52,116 -- 00:37:54,285
that they might find a weakness
and exploit it.

429
00:37:54,869 -- 00:37:58,623
The plans you refer to
will soon be back in our hands.

430
00:37:58,706 -- 00:38:02,960
Any attack made by the rebels against
this station would be a useless gesture,

431
00:38:03,044 -- 00:38:05,129
no matter what technical data
they've obtained.

432
00:38:05,213 -- 00:38:08,841
This station is now
the ultimate power in the universe.

433
00:38:09,509 -- 00:38:11,219
I suggest we use it.

434
00:38:11,302 -- 00:38:15,556
Don't be too proud of this
technological terror you've constructed.

435
00:38:15,640 -- 00:38:19,060
The ability to destroy a planet
is insignificant

436
00:38:19,143 -- 00:38:20,978
next to the power of the Force.

437
00:38:21,062 -- 00:38:24,565
Don't try to frighten us with
your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader.

438
00:38:24,649 -- 00:38:27,485
Your sad devotion
to that ancient religion

439
00:38:27,568 -- 00:38:30,154
has not helped you conjure up
the stolen data tapes

440
00:38:30,655 -- 00:38:33,658
or given you clairvoyance enough
to find the rebels' hidden fortress...

441
00:38:41,290 -- 00:38:43,918
I find your lack of faith disturbing.

442
00:38:45,336 -- 00:38:47,964
Enough of this. Vader, release him.

443
00:38:48,047 -- 00:38:49,507
As you wish.

444
00:38:51,884 -- 00:38:53,845
This bickering is pointless.

445
00:38:55,012 -- 00:38:58,766
Lord Vader will provide us with
the location of the rebel fortress

446
00:38:58,850 -- 00:39:01,435
by the time this station is operational.

447
00:39:01,519 -- 00:39:05,481
We will then crush the rebellion
with one swift stroke.

448
00:39:12,530 -- 00:39:14,490
It looks like the Sandpeople did this,
all right.

449
00:39:14,574 -- 00:39:16,200
There's gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks.

450
00:39:16,284 -- 00:39:19,120
I've just never heard of them
hitting anything this big before.

451
00:39:19,203 -- 00:39:22,123
They didn't, but we are
meant to think they did.

452
00:39:22,206 -- 00:39:24,125
These tracks are side-by-side.

453
00:39:24,208 -- 00:39:28,337
Sandpeople always ride single file
to hide their numbers.

454
00:39:28,421 -- 00:39:31,299
These are the same Jawas
that sold us R2 and 3PO.

455
00:39:31,382 -- 00:39:36,179
And these blast points,
too accurate for Sandpeople.

456
00:39:36,262 -- 00:39:40,183
Only imperial stormtroopers
are so precise.

457
00:39:40,266 -- 00:39:42,894
But why would imperial troops
want to slaughter Jawas?

458
00:39:48,232 -- 00:39:49,650
If they traced the robots here,

459
00:39:49,734 -- 00:39:51,527
they may have learned
who they sold them to

460
00:39:51,611 -- 00:39:53,487
and that would lead them back home.

461
00:39:53,571 -- 00:39:54,614
Wait, Luke.

462
00:39:54,864 -- 00:39:56,866
It's too dangerous.

463
00:40:20,890 -- 00:40:22,767
Uncle Owen.

464
00:40:22,850 -- 00:40:24,685
Aunt Beru.

465
00:40:24,810 -- 00:40:26,187
Uncle Owen.

466
00:41:16,404 -- 00:41:21,993
Now, Your Highness, we will discuss
the location of your hidden rebel base.

467
00:42:05,036 -- 00:42:07,330
There's nothing you could have done,
had you been there.

468
00:42:08,205 -- 00:42:10,124
You'd have been killed too,

469
00:42:10,207 -- 00:42:13,002
and the droids would now be
in the hands of the Empire.

470
00:42:14,712 -- 00:42:17,340
I want to come with you to Alderaan.

471
00:42:17,423 -- 00:42:19,467
There's nothing for me here now.

472
00:42:19,550 -- 00:42:22,553
I want to learn the ways of the Force
and become a Jedi like my father.

473
00:42:38,235 -- 00:42:40,654
Mos Eisley spaceport.

474
00:42:40,738 -- 00:42:46,327
You will never find a more wretched
hive of scum and villainy.

475
00:42:46,410 -- 00:42:47,912
We must be cautious.

476
00:43:29,286 -- 00:43:31,205
How long have you had these droids?

477
00:43:31,288 -- 00:43:34,458
- About three or four seasons.
- They're up for sale if you want them.

478
00:43:35,042 -- 00:43:36,460
Let me see your identification.

479
00:43:37,128 -- 00:43:39,880
You don't need
to see his identification.

480
00:43:40,172 -- 00:43:42,299
We don't need to see his identification.

481
00:43:42,383 -- 00:43:45,219
These aren't the droids
you're looking for.

482
00:43:45,302 -- 00:43:47,221
These aren't the droids
we're looking for.

483
00:43:48,139 -- 00:43:50,474
He can go about his business.

484
00:43:50,558 -- 00:43:53,811
- You can go about your business.
- Move along.

485
00:43:54,145 -- 00:43:56,730
Move along. Move along.

486
00:44:12,830 -- 00:44:16,000
I can't abide those Jawas.
Disgusting creatures.

487
00:44:17,001 -- 00:44:18,878
Go on, go on.

488
00:44:20,171 -- 00:44:22,089
I can't understand
how we got by those troops.

489
00:44:22,173 -- 00:44:23,507
I thought we were dead.

490
00:44:23,591 -- 00:44:27,970
The Force can have a strong influence
on the weak-minded.

491
00:44:31,348 -- 00:44:32,475
You really think we're gonna find

492
00:44:32,558 -- 00:44:34,560
a pilot here that'll
take us to Alderaan?

493
00:44:34,643 -- 00:44:37,396
Most of the best freighter pilots
are to be found here.

494
00:44:37,480 -- 00:44:41,275
Only watch your step,
this place can be a little rough.

495
00:44:41,358 -- 00:44:43,068
I'm ready for anything.

496
00:44:46,864 -- 00:44:48,824
Come along, R2.

497
00:45:38,916 -- 00:45:42,461
- Hey. We don't serve their kind here.
- What?

498
00:45:42,545 -- 00:45:44,463
Your droids,
they'll have to wait outside.

499
00:45:44,547 -- 00:45:45,548
We don't want them here.

500
00:45:45,631 -- 00:45:48,342
Why don't you wait out by the speeder?
We don't want any trouble.

501
00:45:48,425 -- 00:45:50,094
I heartily agree with you, sir.

502
00:45:58,686 -- 00:46:01,188
Uh... I'll have one of those.

503
00:46:37,099 -- 00:46:39,977
- He doesn't like you.
- I'm sorry.

504
00:46:41,145 -- 00:46:44,648
I don't like you either.
You just watch yourself.

505
00:46:44,815 -- 00:46:49,403
We're wanted men. I have the
death sentence on 12 systems.

506
00:46:49,486 -- 00:46:52,281
- I'll be careful then.
- You'll be dead!

507
00:46:52,364 -- 00:46:54,325
This little one's not worth the effort.

508
00:46:55,492 -- 00:46:56,952
Come, let me get you something.

509
00:46:57,202 -- 00:46:58,245
Aah!

510
00:47:24,271 -- 00:47:26,023
I'm all right.

511
00:47:27,566 -- 00:47:32,154
Chewbacca here is first mate
on a ship that might suit us.

512
00:47:36,575 -- 00:47:38,619
I don't like the look of this.

513
00:47:53,425 -- 00:47:57,012
Han Solo. I'm captain
of the iMillennium Falcon./i

514
00:47:57,096 -- 00:48:00,349
Chewie here tells me you're looking
for passage to the Alderaan system.

515
00:48:00,432 -- 00:48:02,810
Yes, indeed, if it's a fast ship.

516
00:48:02,893 -- 00:48:07,189
Fast ship? You've never heard of
the iMillennium Falcon?/i

517
00:48:07,272 -- 00:48:08,357
Should I have?

518
00:48:08,440 -- 00:48:11,610
It's the ship that made the Kessel run
in less than 12 parsecs.

519
00:48:13,654 -- 00:48:15,864
I've outrun imperial starships.

520
00:48:15,948 -- 00:48:17,950
Not the local bulk cruisers, mind you.

521
00:48:18,033 -- 00:48:20,202
I'm talking about
the big Corellian ships now.

522
00:48:22,079 -- 00:48:24,998
She's fast enough for you, old man.

523
00:48:25,082 -- 00:48:28,001
- What's the cargo?
- Only passengers.

524
00:48:28,085 -- 00:48:30,921
Myself, the boy, two droids...

525
00:48:32,089 -- 00:48:34,007
And no questions asked.

526
00:48:35,467 -- 00:48:37,177
What is it, some kind of local trouble?

527
00:48:37,594 -- 00:48:42,433
Let's just say we'd like to avoid
any imperial entanglements.

528
00:48:43,809 -- 00:48:47,062
Well, that's the real trick, isn't it?

529
00:48:47,146 -- 00:48:49,148
And it's gonna cost you
something extra.

530
00:48:50,441 -- 00:48:52,276
Ten thousand, all in advance.

531
00:48:53,944 -- 00:48:55,279
Ten thousand?

532
00:48:56,572 -- 00:48:58,365
We could almost
buy our own ship for that.

533
00:48:59,241 -- 00:49:01,452
But who's gonna fly it, kid? You?

534
00:49:01,535 -- 00:49:03,620
You bet I could.
I'm not such a bad pilot, myself.

535
00:49:03,704 -- 00:49:06,206
We don't have to sit here and listen...

536
00:49:06,790 -- 00:49:09,042
We can pay you 2,000 now,

537
00:49:09,126 -- 00:49:12,463
plus 15 when we reach Alderaan.

538
00:49:13,380 -- 00:49:14,590
Seventeen?

539
00:49:18,051 -- 00:49:20,387
Okay, you guys got yourselves a ship.

540
00:49:20,471 -- 00:49:23,307
We'll leave as soon as you're ready.
Docking Bay 94.

541
00:49:23,390 -- 00:49:24,933
Ninety-four.

542
00:49:25,809 -- 00:49:29,897
Looks like somebody's beginning
to take an interest in your handiwork.

543
00:49:31,148 -- 00:49:32,983
All right. We'll check it out.

544
00:49:44,828 -- 00:49:48,415
Seventeen thousand. Those guys
must really be desperate.

545
00:49:48,499 -- 00:49:52,878
This could really save my neck.
Get back to the ship, get it ready.

546
00:49:52,961 -- 00:49:55,172
- You'll have to sell your speeder.
- That's okay.

547
00:49:55,255 -- 00:49:57,883
I'm never coming back
to this planet again.

548
00:50:00,511 -- 00:50:01,512
Yes, Greedo.

549
00:50:01,595 -- 00:50:03,806
As a matter of fact,
I was just going to see your boss.

550
00:50:03,889 -- 00:50:06,099
Tell Jabba that I've got his money.

551
00:50:19,363 -- 00:50:21,615
Yeah, but this time
I've got the money.

552
00:50:25,744 -- 00:50:28,622
I don't have it with me.
Tell Jabba...

553
00:50:36,880 -- 00:50:38,298
Even I get boarded sometimes.

554
00:50:38,382 -- 00:50:40,634
Do you think I had a choice?

555
00:50:45,556 -- 00:50:46,974
Over my dead body.

556
00:50:52,396 -- 00:50:53,730
I'll bet you have.

557
00:51:07,744 -- 00:51:09,830
Sorry about the mess.

558
00:51:19,006 -- 00:51:22,134
Her resistance to the mind probe
is considerable.

559
00:51:22,217 -- 00:51:25,596
It'll be some time before we can
extract any information from her.

560
00:51:25,679 -- 00:51:29,266
The final checkout is completed.
All systems are operational.

561
00:51:29,349 -- 00:51:31,560
What course shall we set?

562
00:51:31,685 -- 00:51:35,439
Perhaps she would respond
to an alternative form of persuasion.

563
00:51:35,522 -- 00:51:36,773
What do you mean?

564
00:51:36,857 -- 00:51:39,818
I think it is time we demonstrated
the full power of this station.

565
00:51:39,902 -- 00:51:42,404
- Set your course for Alderaan.
- With pleasure.

566
00:51:43,572 -- 00:51:45,616
Lock the door, R2.

567
00:51:47,701 -- 00:51:49,703
All right.
Check this side of the street.

568
00:51:53,874 -- 00:51:56,543
The door's locked.
Move on to the next one.

569
00:52:03,383 -- 00:52:06,345
I would much rather have gone with
Master Luke than stay here with you.

570
00:52:06,803 -- 00:52:10,390
I don't know what this trouble is about,
but I'm sure it must be your fault.

571
00:52:10,474 -- 00:52:12,559
You watch your language.

572
00:52:15,062 -- 00:52:17,981
All right. Give it to me. I'll take it.

573
00:52:18,065 -- 00:52:21,652
Look at this. Ever since the XP-38
came out, they just aren't in demand.

574
00:52:21,735 -- 00:52:23,737
It'll be enough.

575
00:52:46,468 -- 00:52:48,470
Right here, Jabba.

576
00:52:49,846 -- 00:52:51,264
I've been waitin' for you.

577
00:52:55,185 -- 00:52:57,854
You didn't think
I was gonna run, did you?

578
00:53:08,198 -- 00:53:09,658
Jabba, next time
you wanna talk to me,

579
00:53:09,741 -- 00:53:10,909
come see me yourself.

580
00:53:10,992 -- 00:53:12,494
Don't send one of these twerps.

581
00:53:26,800 -- 00:53:30,220
Look, Jabba,
even I get boarded sometimes.

582
00:53:31,054 -- 00:53:33,557
You think I had a choice?

583
00:53:33,640 -- 00:53:35,559
But I got a nice, easy charter.

584
00:53:35,642 -- 00:53:39,730
I'll pay ya back, plus a little extra.
I just need a little more time.

585
00:53:47,988 -- 00:53:50,115
Fifteen, Jabba.
Don't push it.

586
00:54:01,835 -- 00:54:04,588
Jabba, you're a
wonderful human being.

587
00:54:13,513 -- 00:54:17,184
If the ship's as fast as he's boasting,
we ought to do well.

588
00:54:40,874 -- 00:54:42,501
What a piece of junk.

589
00:54:42,584 -- 00:54:45,128
She'll make.5 past light speed.

590
00:54:45,212 -- 00:54:47,964
She may not look like much,
but she's got it where it counts, kid.

591
00:54:48,048 -- 00:54:51,051
I've made a lot of special
modifications myself.

592
00:54:51,134 -- 00:54:55,055
But we're a little rushed, so if you'll
just get on board, we'll get outta here.

593
00:55:00,227 -- 00:55:01,728
Hello, sir.

594
00:55:10,237 -- 00:55:11,446
Which way?

595
00:55:13,323 -- 00:55:15,325
All right, men, load your weapons.

596
00:55:17,577 -- 00:55:19,538
Stop that ship. Blast them.

597
00:55:29,339 -- 00:55:31,341
Chewie, get us out of here!

598
00:55:32,759 -- 00:55:36,346
Oh, my. I'd forgotten
how much I hate space travel.

599
00:55:52,737 -- 00:55:53,822
Grrr...

600
00:55:55,115 -- 00:55:56,533
Looks like an imperial cruiser.

601
00:55:56,616 -- 00:55:58,535
Our passengers
must be hotter than I thought.

602
00:55:58,618 -- 00:56:00,412
Hold 'em off.
Angle the deflector shields

603
00:56:00,495 -- 00:56:02,873
while I make the calculations
for the jump to light speed.

604
00:56:12,549 -- 00:56:15,719
Stay sharp. There's two more comin' in.
They're gonna try and cut us off.

605
00:56:15,802 -- 00:56:18,179
Why don't you outrun 'em?
You said this thing was fast.

606
00:56:18,263 -- 00:56:20,807
Watch your mouth or you're gonna
find yourself floating home.

607
00:56:20,891 -- 00:56:23,310
We'll be safe enough
once we make the jump to hyperspace.

608
00:56:23,393 -- 00:56:25,520
Besides, I know a few manoeuvres.
We'll lose 'em.

609
00:56:30,275 -- 00:56:31,443
Here's where the fun begins.

610
00:56:31,526 -- 00:56:33,361
How long before you can
jump to light speed?

611
00:56:33,445 -- 00:56:36,406
It'll take a few moments to get
the coordinates from the navicomputer.

612
00:56:36,489 -- 00:56:38,408
Are you kidding?
At the rate they're gaining?

613
00:56:38,491 -- 00:56:41,077
Travelling through hyperspace
ain't like dustin' crops, boy.

614
00:56:41,161 -- 00:56:43,663
Without precise calculations,
we'd fly right through a star

615
00:56:43,747 -- 00:56:47,667
or bounce too close to a supernova,
and that would end your trip real quick.

616
00:56:47,751 -- 00:56:50,128
- What's that flashing?
- We're losing a deflector shield.

617
00:56:50,211 -- 00:56:53,006
Go strap yourselves in.
I'm gonna make the jump to light speed.

618
00:57:14,444 -- 00:57:17,113
We've entered the Alderaan system.

619
00:57:17,197 -- 00:57:18,490
Governor Tarkin.

620
00:57:18,573 -- 00:57:21,242
I should have expected
to find you holding Vader's leash.

621
00:57:21,576 -- 00:57:24,955
I recognised your foul stench
when I was brought on board.

622
00:57:26,539 -- 00:57:28,416
Charming to the last.

623
00:57:29,209 -- 00:57:31,044
You don't know how hard I found it

624
00:57:31,169 -- 00:57:33,004
signing the order
to terminate your life.

625
00:57:33,088 -- 00:57:36,049
I'm surprised you had the courage
to take the responsibility yourself.

626
00:57:36,466 -- 00:57:39,219
Princess Leia, before your execution,

627
00:57:39,302 -- 00:57:41,763
I would like you to be my guest
at a ceremony

628
00:57:41,846 -- 00:57:44,808
that will make
this battle station operational.

629
00:57:44,891 -- 00:57:48,144
No star system will dare
oppose the Emperor now.

630
00:57:48,228 -- 00:57:50,480
The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin,

631
00:57:50,563 -- 00:57:53,149
the more star systems
will slip through your fingers.

632
00:57:53,233 -- 00:57:56,528
Not after we demonstrate
the power of this station.

633
00:57:56,611 -- 00:58:00,073
In a way, you have determined
the choice of the planet

634
00:58:00,156 -- 00:58:02,325
that'll be destroyed first.

635
00:58:02,409 -- 00:58:06,913
Since you are reluctant to provide us
with the location of the rebel base,

636
00:58:06,997 -- 00:58:09,833
I have chosen to test
this station's destructive power

637
00:58:09,916 -- 00:58:12,794
on your home planet of Alderaan.

638
00:58:12,877 -- 00:58:15,672
No. Alderaan is peaceful. We have
no weapons. You can't possibly...

639
00:58:15,755 -- 00:58:18,174
You would prefer another target?
A military target?

640
00:58:18,258 -- 00:58:20,427
Then name the system.

641
00:58:22,387 -- 00:58:25,765
I grow tired of asking this,
so it will be the last time.

642
00:58:26,516 -- 00:58:28,435
Where is the rebel base?

643
00:58:32,564 -- 00:58:34,107
Dantooine.

644
00:58:35,025 -- 00:58:36,109
They're on Dantooine.

645
00:58:36,192 -- 00:58:39,612
There. You see, Lord Vader?
She can be reasonable.

646
00:58:39,696 -- 00:58:42,449
Continue with the operation.
You may fire when ready.

647
00:58:42,532 -- 00:58:44,784
- What?
- You're far too trusting.

648
00:58:45,118 -- 00:58:47,704
Dantooine is too remote
to make an effective demonstration.

649
00:58:47,787 -- 00:58:51,875
But don't worry. We will deal with
your rebel friends soon enough.

650
00:58:51,958 -- 00:58:53,209
No!

651
00:58:55,086 -- 00:58:56,504
Commence primary ignition.

652
00:59:19,778 -- 00:59:22,363
Are you all right? What's wrong?

653
00:59:23,364 -- 00:59:25,825
I felt a great disturbance in the Force

654
00:59:25,909 -- 00:59:29,037
as if millions of voices suddenly
cried out in terror

655
00:59:29,120 -- 00:59:31,456
and were suddenly silenced.

656
00:59:31,539 -- 00:59:33,625
I fear something terrible has happened.

657
00:59:35,293 -- 00:59:37,587
You'd better get on with your exercises.

658
00:59:40,381 -- 00:59:42,926
You can forget your troubles
with those imperial slugs.

659
00:59:43,009 -- 00:59:45,470
I told you I'd outrun them.

660
00:59:48,973 -- 00:59:50,725
Don't everybody thank me at once.

661
00:59:51,518 -- 00:59:54,979
Anyway, we should be at Alderaan
about 0200 hours.

662
01:00:02,779 -- 01:00:04,781
Now be careful, R2.

663
01:00:12,831 -- 01:00:14,040
Argh!

664
01:00:14,124 -- 01:00:16,709
He made a fair move.
Screaming about it can't help you.

665
01:00:16,793 -- 01:00:19,045
Let him have it.
It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.

666
01:00:19,129 -- 01:00:21,464
But, sir, nobody worries
about upsetting a droid.

667
01:00:21,840 -- 01:00:24,008
That's 'cause a droid
don't pull people's arms

668
01:00:24,092 -- 01:00:26,136
out of their sockets when they lose.

669
01:00:26,594 -- 01:00:28,805
Wookiees are known to do that.

670
01:00:28,888 -- 01:00:30,014
Grrr...

671
01:00:30,682 -- 01:00:32,350
I see your point, sir.

672
01:00:32,475 -- 01:00:35,687
I suggest a new strategy, R2.
Let the Wookiee win.

673
01:00:36,896 -- 01:00:38,273
Argh!

674
01:00:54,164 -- 01:00:57,792
Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force
flowing through him.

675
01:00:58,543 -- 01:01:00,879
- You mean it controls your actions?
- Partially.

676
01:01:00,962 -- 01:01:02,881
But it also obeys your commands.

677
01:01:05,466 -- 01:01:06,968
Oh!

678
01:01:08,386 -- 01:01:10,096
Hokey religions and ancient weapons

679
01:01:10,180 -- 01:01:12,390
are no match
for a blaster at your side, kid.

680
01:01:13,349 -- 01:01:14,976
You don't believe in the Force, do you?

681
01:01:15,852 -- 01:01:18,313
Kid, I've flown from one side
of this galaxy to the other.

682
01:01:18,396 -- 01:01:19,981
I've seen a lot of strange stuff,

683
01:01:20,064 -- 01:01:22,317
but I've never seen anything
to make me believe

684
01:01:22,400 -- 01:01:25,862
there's one all-powerful force
controlling everything.

685
01:01:26,404 -- 01:01:30,033
There's no mystical energy field
controls my destiny.

686
01:01:30,158 -- 01:01:33,119
It's all a lot of
simple tricks and nonsense.

687
01:01:33,203 -- 01:01:36,080
I suggest you try it again, Luke.

688
01:01:37,624 -- 01:01:40,293
This time, let go your conscious self

689
01:01:42,378 -- 01:01:44,589
and act on instinct.

690
01:01:45,590 -- 01:01:49,093
With the blast shield down, I can't see.
How am I supposed to fight?

691
01:01:49,177 -- 01:01:51,387
Your eyes can deceive you.
Don't trust them.

692
01:02:01,231 -- 01:02:03,149
Stretch out with your feelings.

693
01:02:17,789 -- 01:02:19,791
You see? You can do it.

694
01:02:20,375 -- 01:02:21,542
I call it luck.

695
01:02:21,626 -- 01:02:24,254
In my experience,
there's no such thing as luck.

696
01:02:24,796 -- 01:02:26,881
Look, good against remotes is one thing.

697
01:02:26,965 -- 01:02:30,134
Good against the living,
that's something else.

698
01:02:30,218 -- 01:02:32,804
Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan.

699
01:02:36,307 -- 01:02:39,060
You know, I did feel something.
I could almost see the remote.

700
01:02:39,143 -- 01:02:43,940
That's good. You've taken
your first step into a larger world.

701
01:02:48,611 -- 01:02:50,363
Yes?

702
01:02:50,446 -- 01:02:52,198
Our scout ships
have reached Dantooine.

703
01:02:52,282 -- 01:02:54,158
They found the remains of a rebel base,

704
01:02:54,242 -- 01:02:56,661
but they estimate that
it has been deserted for some time.

705
01:02:56,744 -- 01:03:00,456
They are now conducting an extensive
search of the surrounding systems.

706
01:03:01,082 -- 01:03:03,668
She lied. She lied to us.

707
01:03:03,751 -- 01:03:07,463
I told you she would never
consciously betray the rebellion.

708
01:03:08,923 -- 01:03:10,967
Terminate her immediately.

709
01:03:13,970 -- 01:03:16,514
Stand by, Chewie. Here we go.
Cut in the sublight engines.

710
01:03:19,309 -- 01:03:20,476
What the...

711
01:03:21,978 -- 01:03:23,938
Aarghh arrgh!

712
01:03:24,022 -- 01:03:26,149
We've come out of hyperspace
into a meteor shower,

713
01:03:26,232 -- 01:03:27,567
some kind of asteroid collision.

714
01:03:27,650 -- 01:03:29,736
- It's not on any of the charts.
- What's going on?

715
01:03:29,819 -- 01:03:31,863
Our position's correct,
except no Alderaan.

716
01:03:31,946 -- 01:03:34,824
- What do you mean? Where is it?
- That's what I'm trying to tell you.

717
01:03:34,907 -- 01:03:36,409
It ain't there. It's been blown away.

718
01:03:36,492 -- 01:03:38,828
- What? How?
- Destroyed by the Empire.

719
01:03:38,911 -- 01:03:41,289
The entire starfleet
couldn't destroy the whole planet.

720
01:03:41,372 -- 01:03:44,167
It'd take a thousand ships
with more firepower than I've...

721
01:03:45,668 -- 01:03:48,463
- There's another ship coming in.
- Maybe they know what happened.

722
01:03:48,546 -- 01:03:49,881
It's an imperial fighter.

723
01:03:51,424 -- 01:03:54,344
- It followed us.
- No. It's a short-range fighter.

724
01:03:54,427 -- 01:03:56,888
There aren't any bases around here.
Where did it come from?

725
01:03:59,140 -- 01:04:02,226
Sure is leaving in a big hurry.
If they identify us, we're in trouble.

726
01:04:02,310 -- 01:04:04,479
Not if I can help it.
Chewie, jam its transmissions.

727
01:04:04,562 -- 01:04:07,982
- Let it go. It's too far out of range.
- Not for long.

728
01:04:11,736 -- 01:04:15,073
A fighter that size couldn't get
this deep into space on its own.

729
01:04:15,156 -- 01:04:17,825
He must have gotten lost,
been part of a convoy or something.

730
01:04:18,117 -- 01:04:20,703
He ain't gonna be around
long enough to tell anybody about us.

731
01:04:23,081 -- 01:04:25,124
Look at him.
He's heading for that small moon.

732
01:04:25,208 -- 01:04:28,044
I think I can get him before he
gets there. He's almost in range.

733
01:04:29,379 -- 01:04:31,422
That's no moon.

734
01:04:31,506 -- 01:04:34,884
- It's a space station.
- It's too big to be a space station.

735
01:04:38,262 -- 01:04:40,681
I have a very bad feeling about this.

736
01:04:40,765 -- 01:04:42,600
Turn the ship around.

737
01:04:42,683 -- 01:04:45,269
Yeah. I think you're right.
Full reverse.

738
01:04:45,353 -- 01:04:47,021
Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.

739
01:04:51,859 -- 01:04:54,028
Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.

740
01:04:56,197 -- 01:04:57,698
Why are we still moving towards it?

741
01:04:57,782 -- 01:04:59,867
We're caught in a tractor beam.
It's pulling us in.

742
01:04:59,951 -- 01:05:01,619
There's gotta be something you can do.

743
01:05:01,702 -- 01:05:04,455
There's nothing I can do, kid.
I'm at full power. I have to shut down.

744
01:05:04,539 -- 01:05:06,249
They're not gonna
get me without a fight.

745
01:05:10,711 -- 01:05:14,132
You can't win,
but there are alternatives to fighting.

746
01:05:30,815 -- 01:05:32,900
iClear Bay 327./i

747
01:05:32,984 -- 01:05:35,361
iWe are opening the magnetic field./i

748
01:05:50,001 -- 01:05:52,295
To your stations. Come with me.

749
01:05:56,799 -- 01:06:00,428
iClose all outboard shields.
Close all outboard shields./i

750
01:06:01,596 -- 01:06:02,597
Yes?

751
01:06:02,680 -- 01:06:05,850
iWe've captured a freighter entering
the remains of the Alderaan system./i

752
01:06:05,933 -- 01:06:09,896
iIts markings match those of a ship
that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley./i

753
01:06:09,979 -- 01:06:13,691
They must be trying to return
the stolen plans to the princess.

754
01:06:13,774 -- 01:06:16,569
She may yet be of some use to us.

755
01:06:21,699 -- 01:06:25,703
iUnlock one, five, seven and nine.
Release charge./i

756
01:06:27,205 -- 01:06:29,373
iThree-one-six, report to control./i

757
01:06:33,085 -- 01:06:34,337
There's no one on board, sir.

758
01:06:34,420 -- 01:06:37,215
According to the log, the crew
abandoned ship right after take-off.

759
01:06:37,924 -- 01:06:40,927
It must be a decoy, sir. Several escape
pods have been jettisoned.

760
01:06:41,010 -- 01:06:42,887
- Did you find any droids?
- No, sir.

761
01:06:42,970 -- 01:06:45,056
If there were any,
they must also have jettisoned.

762
01:06:45,139 -- 01:06:48,476
Send a scanning crew aboard.
I want every part of this ship checked.

763
01:06:48,559 -- 01:06:49,685
Yes, sir.

764
01:06:49,769 -- 01:06:51,354
I sense something,

765
01:06:51,437 -- 01:06:54,273
a presence I've not felt since...

766
01:06:56,442 -- 01:06:58,361
Get me a scanning crew in here
on the double.

767
01:06:58,444 -- 01:07:00,071
I want every part of this ship checked.

768
01:07:08,829 -- 01:07:10,831
There's no one here.

769
01:07:20,049 -- 01:07:22,009
Boy, it's lucky you have
these compartments.

770
01:07:22,093 -- 01:07:25,221
I use them for smuggling. I never
thought I'd be smuggling myself in 'em.

771
01:07:25,304 -- 01:07:26,514
This is ridiculous.

772
01:07:26,597 -- 01:07:29,350
Even if I could take off,
I'd never get past the tractor beam.

773
01:07:29,433 -- 01:07:30,560
Leave that to me.

774
01:07:30,643 -- 01:07:33,854
Damn fool.
I knew you were gonna say that.

775
01:07:33,938 -- 01:07:37,608
Who's the more foolish,
the fool or the fool who follows him?

776
01:07:38,025 -- 01:07:39,569
Argh!

777
01:07:46,867 -- 01:07:51,414
The ship's all yours. If the scanners
pick up anything, report it immediately.

778
01:07:52,290 -- 01:07:54,292
All right. Let's go.

779
01:08:08,514 -- 01:08:10,516
Hey, down there.

780
01:08:12,268 -- 01:08:14,270
Could you give us a hand with this?

781
01:08:22,653 -- 01:08:25,698
TK-421, why aren't you at your post?

782
01:08:25,990 -- 01:08:27,992
TK-421, do you copy?

783
01:08:40,421 -- 01:08:43,674
Take over. We've got a bad transmitter.
I'll see what I can do.

784
01:08:46,594 -- 01:08:47,887
Grrr!

785
01:09:00,858 -- 01:09:02,943
Between his howling
and your blasting everything,

786
01:09:03,027 -- 01:09:05,321
it's a wonder the whole station
doesn't know we're here.

787
01:09:05,404 -- 01:09:08,699
Bring 'em on. I prefer a straight fight
to all this sneakin' around.

788
01:09:08,866 -- 01:09:10,576
We've found the computer outlet, sir.

789
01:09:10,660 -- 01:09:13,704
Plug in. He should be able to
interpret the entire imperial network.

790
01:09:25,091 -- 01:09:28,469
He says he's found the controls to the
power beam that's holding the ship here.

791
01:09:28,552 -- 01:09:31,138
He'll try to make the precise location
appear on the monitor.

792
01:09:31,806 -- 01:09:35,726
The tractor beam is coupled
to the main reactor in seven locations.

793
01:09:35,810 -- 01:09:39,146
A power loss at one of the terminals
will allow the ship to leave.

794
01:09:41,565 -- 01:09:44,819
I don't think you boys can help.
I must go alone.

795
01:09:44,902 -- 01:09:48,364
Whatever you say. I've done more than
I bargained for on this trip already.

796
01:09:48,489 -- 01:09:49,615
I want to go with you.

797
01:09:49,699 -- 01:09:52,535
Be patient, Luke.
Stay and watch over the droids.

798
01:09:52,618 -- 01:09:54,036
They must be delivered safely

799
01:09:54,120 -- 01:09:57,832
or other star systems will suffer
the same fate as Alderaan.

800
01:09:57,915 -- 01:10:01,252
Your destiny lies along
a different path from mine.

801
01:10:04,922 -- 01:10:06,674
The Force will be with you...

802
01:10:07,049 -- 01:10:08,467
Always.

803
01:10:14,390 -- 01:10:17,435
Argh argh argh!

804
01:10:17,601 -- 01:10:19,895
You said it, Chewie.

805
01:10:19,979 -- 01:10:22,398
Where did you dig up that old fossil?

806
01:10:23,649 -- 01:10:25,151
Ben is a great man.

807
01:10:25,234 -- 01:10:28,320
- Yeah. Great at getting us into trouble.
- I didn't hear you give any ideas.

808
01:10:28,404 -- 01:10:31,532
Anything's better than just hangin'
around waiting for 'em to pick us up.

809
01:10:31,615 -- 01:10:33,617
Who do you think...

810
01:10:33,701 -- 01:10:36,954
- What is it?
- I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.

811
01:10:37,037 -- 01:10:39,874
He says, I've found her,
and keeps repeating, She's here.

812
01:10:39,957 -- 01:10:42,501
Who? Who has he found?

813
01:10:42,585 -- 01:10:45,212
- Princess Leia.
- The princess? She's here?

814
01:10:45,296 -- 01:10:46,964
- Princess?
- Where? Where is she?

815
01:10:47,047 -- 01:10:48,966
Princess? What's going on?

816
01:10:54,388 -- 01:10:57,183
Level 5, Detention Block AA-23.

817
01:11:01,979 -- 01:11:04,648
I'm afraid she's scheduled
to be terminated.

818
01:11:04,732 -- 01:11:07,735
Oh, no. We've gotta do something.

819
01:11:07,818 -- 01:11:10,279
- What are you talking about?
- The droids belong to her.

820
01:11:10,362 -- 01:11:12,406
She's the one in the message.
We gotta help her.

821
01:11:12,490 -- 01:11:15,242
Don't get any funny ideas.
The old man wants us to wait here.

822
01:11:15,326 -- 01:11:18,621
He didn't know she was here.
Find a way into that detention block.

823
01:11:18,704 -- 01:11:21,582
- I'm not going anywhere.
- They're gonna execute her.

824
01:11:21,665 -- 01:11:24,877
You said you didn't want to just wait
to be captured. Now you want to stay?

825
01:11:25,169 -- 01:11:28,005
Marching into the detention area
is not what I had in mind.

826
01:11:28,088 -- 01:11:30,925
- But they're gonna kill her.
- Better her than me.

827
01:11:38,849 -- 01:11:40,017
She's rich.

828
01:11:40,309 -- 01:11:42,436
Argh!

829
01:11:43,187 -- 01:11:44,605
Rich?

830
01:11:44,688 -- 01:11:49,026
Rich, powerful. If you were to
rescue her, the reward would be...

831
01:11:49,109 -- 01:11:51,612
- What?
- Well, more wealth than you can imagine.

832
01:11:51,695 -- 01:11:53,823
I don't know. I can imagine quite a bit.

833
01:11:53,906 -- 01:11:55,866
- You'll get it.
- I better.

834
01:11:55,950 -- 01:11:57,660
You will.

835
01:11:57,743 -- 01:11:59,995
All right, kid.
You better be right about this.

836
01:12:00,079 -- 01:12:02,081
- All right.
- What's your plan?

837
01:12:03,082 -- 01:12:05,584
3PO, hand me those binders there,
will you?

838
01:12:07,127 -- 01:12:08,546
Okay.

839
01:12:09,213 -- 01:12:11,215
Now, I'm gonna put these on you.

840
01:12:11,298 -- 01:12:12,508
Grrr!

841
01:12:12,633 -- 01:12:15,845
Okay, Han, you put those on.

842
01:12:16,679 -- 01:12:19,056
Don't worry, Chewie.
I think I know what he has in mind.

843
01:12:20,099 -- 01:12:21,934
Master Luke, sir, pardon me for asking,

844
01:12:22,017 -- 01:12:24,854
but what should R2 and I do
if we're discovered here?

845
01:12:25,604 -- 01:12:28,858
- Lock the door.
- And hope they don't have blasters.

846
01:12:28,941 -- 01:12:30,985
That isn't very reassuring.

847
01:12:36,490 -- 01:12:37,700
Grrr!

848
01:12:51,255 -- 01:12:55,885
i517 to scan control.

5-3 to upper bay door./i

851
01:13:22,453 -- 01:13:24,788
I can't see a thing
in this helmet.

852
01:13:56,028 -- 01:13:58,739
- This is not gonna work.
- Why didn't you say so before?

853
01:13:58,822 -- 01:14:00,824
I did say so before.

854
01:14:15,798 -- 01:14:19,051
Where are you taking this thing?

855
01:14:19,134 -- 01:14:21,887
Prisoner transfer from Cell Block 1138.

856
01:14:23,180 -- 01:14:25,099
I wasn't notified.

857
01:14:25,182 -- 01:14:27,184
I'll have to clear it.

858
01:14:32,439 -- 01:14:33,607
Argh!

859
01:14:33,691 -- 01:14:36,235
- Look out! He's loose!
- He'll tear us all apart!

860
01:15:00,551 -- 01:15:01,552
Look out.

861
01:15:07,391 -- 01:15:08,767
Aargh!

862
01:15:11,729 -- 01:15:14,189
We gotta find out which cell
this princess of yours is in.

863
01:15:14,273 -- 01:15:16,483
Here it is. 2187. You go and get her.

864
01:15:16,567 -- 01:15:18,569
I'll hold them here.

865
01:15:22,906 -- 01:15:25,117
Everything's under control.
Situation normal.

866
01:15:25,200 -- 01:15:26,285
iWhat happened?/i

867
01:15:26,368 -- 01:15:28,412
Had a slight weapons malfunction,

868
01:15:28,495 -- 01:15:30,914
but everything's
perfectly all right now.

869
01:15:30,998 -- 01:15:34,168
We're fine. We're all fine here now.
Thank you.

870
01:15:34,251 -- 01:15:36,920
- How are you?
i- We're sending a squad up./i

871
01:15:37,921 -- 01:15:41,300
Negative, negative.
We have a reactor leak here now.

872
01:15:41,383 -- 01:15:45,095
Give us a few minutes to lock it down.
Large leak, very dangerous.

873
01:15:45,179 -- 01:15:48,307
iWho is this?
What's your operating number?/i

874
01:15:50,184 -- 01:15:53,896
Boring conversation anyway.
Luke, we're gonna have company!

875
01:16:07,951 -- 01:16:09,912
Aren't you a little short
for a stormtrooper?

876
01:16:09,995 -- 01:16:12,539
Huh? Oh, the uniform.

877
01:16:14,416 -- 01:16:16,293
I'm Luke Skywalker.
I'm here to rescue you.

878
01:16:16,376 -- 01:16:17,377
You're who?

879
01:16:17,461 -- 01:16:19,338
I'm here to rescue you.
I've got your R2 unit.

880
01:16:19,421 -- 01:16:21,590
- I'm here with Ben Kenobi.
- Ben Kenobi? Where is he?

881
01:16:21,673 -- 01:16:22,966
Come on.

882
01:16:24,551 -- 01:16:28,388
- He is here.
- Obi-Wan Kenobi?

883
01:16:28,472 -- 01:16:31,850
- What makes you think so?
- A tremor in the Force.

884
01:16:31,934 -- 01:16:35,813
The last time I felt it
was in the presence of my old master.

885
01:16:36,021 -- 01:16:38,315
Surely he must be dead by now.

886
01:16:38,398 -- 01:16:41,235
Don't underestimate the Force.

887
01:16:41,860 -- 01:16:45,906
The Jedi are extinct.
Their fire has gone out of the universe.

888
01:16:45,989 -- 01:16:49,284
You, my friend, are all that's left
of their religion.

889
01:16:49,368 -- 01:16:50,577
Yes.

890
01:16:50,661 -- 01:16:54,164
iWe have an emergency alert
in Detention Block AA-23./i

891
01:16:54,957 -- 01:16:57,459
The princess? Put all sections on alert.

892
01:16:57,709 -- 01:17:01,171
Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.

893
01:17:01,255 -- 01:17:04,091
If you're right,
he must not be allowed to escape.

894
01:17:04,174 -- 01:17:07,678
Escape is not his plan.
I must face him alone.

895
01:17:15,269 -- 01:17:16,562
Argh!

896
01:17:17,229 -- 01:17:18,814
Get behind me. Get behind me.

897
01:17:30,367 -- 01:17:32,703
Watch your left.
They went down the cell bay.

898
01:17:35,706 -- 01:17:36,707
Can't get out that way.

899
01:17:36,790 -- 01:17:39,209
Looks like you managed to cut off
our only escape route.

900
01:17:39,293 -- 01:17:41,753
Maybe you'd like it back in your cell,
Your Highness.

901
01:17:43,797 -- 01:17:45,966
- C-3PO. C-3PO.
i- Yes, sir?/i

902
01:17:46,049 -- 01:17:49,553
Are there any other ways out of
the cell bay? We've been cut off.

903
01:17:52,014 -- 01:17:53,891
What was that? I didn't copy.

904
01:17:54,183 -- 01:17:57,519
I said all systems have been
alerted to your presence, sir.

905
01:17:57,603 -- 01:18:00,147
The main entrance
seems to be the only way in or out.

906
01:18:00,230 -- 01:18:02,482
All other information on your level
is restricted.

907
01:18:02,566 -- 01:18:05,569
Open up in there. Open up in there.

908
01:18:06,445 -- 01:18:07,863
Oh, no.

909
01:18:07,988 -- 01:18:09,573
There isn't any other way out.

910
01:18:12,034 -- 01:18:13,243
Argh!

911
01:18:15,078 -- 01:18:17,414
I can't hold them off forever. Now what?

912
01:18:17,497 -- 01:18:18,582
This is some rescue.

913
01:18:18,665 -- 01:18:21,376
When you came in here,
didn't you have a plan for getting out?

914
01:18:21,460 -- 01:18:23,086
He's the brains, sweetheart.

915
01:18:23,170 -- 01:18:24,838
Well, I didn't...

916
01:18:26,256 -- 01:18:29,426
- What the hell are you doing?
- Somebody has to save our skins.

917
01:18:31,678 -- 01:18:33,472
Into the garbage chute, flyboy.

918
01:18:41,021 -- 01:18:43,148
- Get in there!
- Aargh!

919
01:18:43,232 -- 01:18:46,235
Get in there, you big furry oaf.
I don't care what you smell.

920
01:18:47,277 -- 01:18:49,571
Get in there, and don't worry about it.

921
01:18:52,282 -- 01:18:53,283
Wonderful girl.

922
01:18:55,452 -- 01:18:57,746
Either I'm gonna kill her,
or I'm beginning to like her.

923
01:19:00,165 -- 01:19:01,166
Get in there.

924
01:19:05,921 -- 01:19:07,506
Wa-hoo!

925
01:19:11,176 -- 01:19:12,386
Argh!

926
01:19:14,763 -- 01:19:18,225
The garbage chute was
a really wonderful idea.

927
01:19:18,308 -- 01:19:20,769
What an incredible smell
you've discovered.

928
01:19:23,814 -- 01:19:25,607
Let's get out of here.

929
01:19:25,691 -- 01:19:28,151
- Get away from there.
- No, wait.

930
01:19:34,825 -- 01:19:37,202
Forget it! I already tried it!
It's magnetically sealed.

931
01:19:37,286 -- 01:19:39,579
Put that thing away!
You're gonna get us all killed!

932
01:19:39,663 -- 01:19:41,415
Absolutely, Your Worship.

933
01:19:41,498 -- 01:19:44,334
Look, I had everything under control
till you led us down here.

934
01:19:44,418 -- 01:19:47,045
It's not gonna take 'em long
to figure out what happened to us.

935
01:19:47,129 -- 01:19:48,422
It could be worse.

936
01:19:53,260 -- 01:19:54,303
It's worse.

937
01:19:54,386 -- 01:19:57,431
- There's something alive in here.
- That's your imagination.

938
01:19:58,348 -- 01:20:00,183
Something just moved past my leg.

939
01:20:02,019 -- 01:20:05,063
- Look. Did you see that?
- What?

940
01:20:26,710 -- 01:20:28,462
Kid! Luke!

941
01:20:29,463 -- 01:20:31,089
Luke!

942
01:20:32,174 -- 01:20:33,383
Luke!

943
01:20:41,058 -- 01:20:42,768
Grab hold of this!

944
01:20:43,143 -- 01:20:45,228
Blast it! My gun's jammed.

945
01:20:45,312 -- 01:20:48,065
- Where?
- Anywhere!

946
01:20:55,906 -- 01:20:57,032
Luke! Luke!

947
01:21:20,680 -- 01:21:22,349
Help him!

948
01:21:22,432 -- 01:21:24,393
- What happened?
- I don't know.

949
01:21:24,476 -- 01:21:27,312
It just let go of me and disappeared.

950
01:21:33,360 -- 01:21:35,779
I got a bad feeling about this.

951
01:21:41,451 -- 01:21:42,452
The walls are moving!

952
01:21:42,536 -- 01:21:44,913
Don't just stand there.
Try and brace it with something.

953
01:21:49,251 -- 01:21:50,585
Grrr!

954
01:21:53,296 -- 01:21:54,881
Help me.

955
01:22:07,769 -- 01:22:09,521
Wait a minute.

956
01:22:11,940 -- 01:22:15,152
3PO! Come in, 3PO!

957
01:22:15,944 -- 01:22:17,404
i3PO!/i

958
01:22:17,487 -- 01:22:19,531
iWhere could he be?/i

959
01:22:23,702 -- 01:22:25,871
Take over. See to him.

960
01:22:28,331 -- 01:22:29,833
Look, there.

961
01:22:32,294 -- 01:22:34,629
They're madmen.
They're heading for the prison level.

962
01:22:34,713 -- 01:22:36,631
If you hurry, you might catch them.

963
01:22:36,715 -- 01:22:38,216
Follow me.

964
01:22:41,970 -- 01:22:44,014
You stand guard.

965
01:22:48,685 -- 01:22:50,020
Come on.

966
01:22:53,982 -- 01:22:55,025
Oh.

967
01:22:57,986 -- 01:23:01,114
All this excitement has overrun
the circuits in my counterpart here.

968
01:23:01,198 -- 01:23:04,326
If you don't mind, I'd like to
take him down to maintenance.

969
01:23:04,409 -- 01:23:05,994
All right.

970
01:23:13,084 -- 01:23:15,170
Argh! Argh!

971
01:23:18,173 -- 01:23:20,926
3PO. Come in, 3PO.

972
01:23:21,009 -- 01:23:22,469
3PO.

973
01:23:22,552 -- 01:23:25,222
- Get on top.
- I can't.

974
01:23:25,305 -- 01:23:27,224
Where could he be? 3PO.

975
01:23:28,600 -- 01:23:30,435
3PO, will you come in?

976
01:23:31,186 -- 01:23:33,438
They aren't here. Something must have
happened to them.

977
01:23:33,522 -- 01:23:36,149
See if they've been captured. Hurry.

978
01:23:39,986 -- 01:23:42,906
One thing's for sure.
We're all gonna be a lot thinner.

979
01:23:45,283 -- 01:23:48,078
- Get on top of it.
- I'm trying.

980
01:23:53,458 -- 01:23:57,420
Thank goodness they haven't
found them. Where could they be?

981
01:23:58,838 -- 01:24:01,508
Use the comlink? Oh, my.

982
01:24:01,591 -- 01:24:03,176
I forgot. I turned it off.

983
01:24:07,430 -- 01:24:10,141
- Are you there, sir?
- 3PO?

984
01:24:10,517 -- 01:24:13,144
- We've had some problems.
i- Will you shut up and listen to me?/i

985
01:24:13,228 -- 01:24:16,982
Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level. Do you copy?

986
01:24:17,065 -- 01:24:20,068
Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level!

987
01:24:21,194 -- 01:24:23,863
iShut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level!/i

988
01:24:23,947 -- 01:24:26,700
No, shut them all down. Hurry! Oh, no.

989
01:24:38,295 -- 01:24:39,796
What?

990
01:24:40,880 -- 01:24:42,632
You did great, 3PO!

991
01:24:43,133 -- 01:24:45,093
Listen to them. They're dying, R2.

992
01:24:45,176 -- 01:24:47,387
Curse my metal body.
I wasn't fast enough.

993
01:24:47,470 -- 01:24:50,557
It's all my fault. My poor master.

994
01:24:50,640 -- 01:24:52,225
We're all right. You did great!

995
01:24:53,184 -- 01:24:55,520
Hey! Open the pressure
maintenance hatch

996
01:24:55,604 -- 01:24:57,022
on unit number... Where are we?

997
01:24:57,564 -- 01:25:00,358
i3263827./i

998
01:25:46,529 -- 01:25:49,949
If we can avoid any more female advice,
we oughta be able to get out of here.

999
01:25:50,033 -- 01:25:51,701
Let's get moving.

1000
01:25:51,951 -- 01:25:53,411
Grrr!

1001
01:25:53,495 -- 01:25:55,580
Where you goin'?

1002
01:25:55,664 -- 01:25:57,499
Wait! They'll hear!

1003
01:25:59,292 -- 01:26:00,669
Come here, you big coward.

1004
01:26:00,752 -- 01:26:02,420
- Chewie, come here.
- Listen.

1005
01:26:03,296 -- 01:26:06,049
I don't know who you are
or where you came from,

1006
01:26:06,132 -- 01:26:08,968
but from now on,
you do as I tell you, okay?

1007
01:26:09,886 -- 01:26:12,806
Look, Your Worshipfulness,
let's get one thing straight.

1008
01:26:12,889 -- 01:26:16,184
I take orders from just one person. Me.

1009
01:26:16,267 -- 01:26:18,186
It's a wonder you're still alive.

1010
01:26:18,269 -- 01:26:21,481
Will somebody get
this big walking carpet out of my way?

1011
01:26:21,564 -- 01:26:23,858
No reward is worth this.

1012
01:26:34,077 -- 01:26:35,995
Give me regular reports, please.

1013
01:26:36,079 -- 01:26:37,163
Right.

1014
01:26:39,332 -- 01:26:42,627
- Do you know what's going on?
- Maybe it's another drill.

1015
01:26:47,632 -- 01:26:49,551
You seen that new VT-16?

1016
01:26:49,634 -- 01:26:51,928
Yeah. Some of the other guys
were telling me about it.

1017
01:26:52,011 -- 01:26:54,013
They say it's quite a thing to see.

1018
01:26:54,097 -- 01:26:56,307
What was that?

1019
01:26:56,391 -- 01:26:59,644
It's nothing. Outgassing.
Don't worry about it.

1020
01:27:04,649 -- 01:27:06,609
- There she is.
- C-3PO, do you copy?

1021
01:27:06,860 -- 01:27:07,861
iYes, sir./i

1022
01:27:07,944 -- 01:27:09,821
- Are you safe?
i- For the moment./i

1023
01:27:10,321 -- 01:27:12,240
We're in the main hangar
across from the ship.

1024
01:27:14,576 -- 01:27:16,286
We're right above you. Stand by.

1025
01:27:16,369 -- 01:27:18,955
You came in that thing?
You're braver than I thought.

1026
01:27:19,038 -- 01:27:21,040
Nice. Come on.

1027
01:27:24,711 -- 01:27:26,129
It's them. Blast them.

1028
01:27:27,589 -- 01:27:28,882
- Get back to the ship!
- Aargh!

1029
01:27:28,965 -- 01:27:31,176
- Where are you going?
- He certainly has courage.

1030
01:27:31,259 -- 01:27:34,387
What good will it do us
if he gets himself killed? Come on.

1031
01:27:40,268 -- 01:27:41,644
Aaaah!

1032
01:27:59,871 -- 01:28:01,873
I think we took a wrong turn.

1033
01:28:06,836 -- 01:28:07,837
There's no lock.

1034
01:28:11,883 -- 01:28:14,761
- That oughta hold them for a while.
- Quick. We've got to get across.

1035
01:28:14,844 -- 01:28:18,181
- Find the controls to extend the bridge.
- I think I just blasted it.

1036
01:28:18,264 -- 01:28:19,891
They're coming through.

1037
01:28:42,247 -- 01:28:43,915
Here, hold this.

1038
01:29:00,640 -- 01:29:01,850
Here they come.

1039
01:29:12,694 -- 01:29:14,237
For luck.

1040
01:29:20,368 -- 01:29:25,081
We think they may be splitting up.
They may be on Level 5 and 6 now, sir.

1041
01:29:39,178 -- 01:29:41,222
Where could they be?

1042
01:29:45,310 -- 01:29:46,853
Close the blast doors.

1043
01:29:54,027 -- 01:29:56,279
Open the blast doors.
Open the blast doors.

1044
01:30:14,797 -- 01:30:20,261
I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.
We meet again at last.

1045
01:30:20,345 -- 01:30:22,055
The circle is now complete.

1046
01:30:22,430 -- 01:30:24,349
When I left you, I was but the learner.

1047
01:30:24,432 -- 01:30:26,809
Now I am the master.

1048
01:30:26,893 -- 01:30:29,228
Only a master of evil, Darth.

1049
01:30:49,207 -- 01:30:51,501
Your powers are weak, old man.

1050
01:30:52,168 -- 01:30:55,338
You can't win, Darth.
If you strike me down,

1051
01:30:55,421 -- 01:30:58,841
I shall become more powerful
than you can possibly imagine.

1052
01:31:06,182 -- 01:31:08,226
You should not have come back.

1053
01:31:33,960 -- 01:31:35,586
Didn't we just leave this party?

1054
01:31:35,753 -- 01:31:36,838
Aargh!

1055
01:31:38,339 -- 01:31:40,842
- What kept you?
- We ran into some old friends.

1056
01:31:40,925 -- 01:31:43,219
- The ship all right?
- Seems okay, if we can get to it.

1057
01:31:43,344 -- 01:31:45,304
I hope the old man got
the tractor beam down.

1058
01:32:00,653 -- 01:32:01,904
Look.

1059
01:32:04,824 -- 01:32:06,784
Come on, R2. We're going.

1060
01:32:08,453 -- 01:32:09,579
Now's our chance. Go!

1061
01:32:13,458 -- 01:32:14,709
Ben?

1062
01:32:29,891 -- 01:32:30,892
No!

1063
01:32:39,692 -- 01:32:40,860
- Come on!
- Luke, come on!

1064
01:32:41,819 -- 01:32:43,404
Come on!

1065
01:32:43,488 -- 01:32:46,616
- Luke, it's too late!
- Blast the door, kid!

1066
01:32:56,250 -- 01:32:57,794
iRun, Luke, run./i

1067
01:33:00,963 -- 01:33:03,382
I hope that old man got
the tractor beam out of commission,

1068
01:33:03,466 -- 01:33:05,593
or this is gonna be a short trip.
Okay, hit it!

1069
01:33:17,021 -- 01:33:18,689
Aargh aargh!

1070
01:33:37,750 -- 01:33:39,669
We're coming up on their sentry ships.

1071
01:33:39,752 -- 01:33:41,546
Hold them off.
Angle the deflector shields

1072
01:33:41,629 -- 01:33:43,256
while I charge up the main guns.

1073
01:33:52,348 -- 01:33:54,350
I can't believe he's gone.

1074
01:33:58,271 -- 01:34:00,064
There wasn't anything
you could have done.

1075
01:34:00,773 -- 01:34:02,733
Come on, buddy.
We're not out of this yet.

1076
01:34:19,584 -- 01:34:21,961
You in, kid? Okay, stay sharp.

1077
01:34:32,805 -- 01:34:33,931
Here they come.

1078
01:34:51,949 -- 01:34:53,784
They're coming in too fast!

1079
01:35:01,792 -- 01:35:05,630
- We've lost the lateral controls.
- Don't worry. She'll hold together.

1080
01:35:07,298 -- 01:35:09,217
Hear me, baby? Hold together.

1081
01:35:25,942 -- 01:35:27,276
Ha ha!

1082
01:35:31,280 -- 01:35:32,865
Got him. I got him!

1083
01:35:33,157 -- 01:35:35,326
Great, kid. Don't get cocky.

1084
01:35:36,535 -- 01:35:38,329
There's still two more of them
out there.

1085
01:36:12,196 -- 01:36:15,032
- That's it. We did it.
- We did it.

1086
01:36:15,992 -- 01:36:18,536
Help. I think I'm melting.
This is all your fault.

1087
01:36:26,544 -- 01:36:27,962
Are they away?

1088
01:36:28,045 -- 01:36:31,007
They've just made the jump
into hyperspace.

1089
01:36:31,090 -- 01:36:34,510
You're sure the homing beacon
is secure aboard their ship?

1090
01:36:35,720 -- 01:36:38,264
I'm taking an awful risk, Vader.

1091
01:36:38,347 -- 01:36:40,016
This had better work.

1092
01:36:40,808 -- 01:36:43,060
Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?

1093
01:36:43,144 -- 01:36:46,188
You know,
sometimes I amaze even myself.

1094
01:36:46,522 -- 01:36:48,649
That doesn't sound too hard.

1095
01:36:48,733 -- 01:36:52,737
They let us go. It's the only
explanation for the ease of our escape.

1096
01:36:52,820 -- 01:36:55,614
- Easy? You call that easy?
- They're tracking us.

1097
01:36:55,698 -- 01:36:57,116
Not this ship, sister.

1098
01:36:58,409 -- 01:37:00,953
At least the information in R2
is still intact.

1099
01:37:01,203 -- 01:37:03,456
What's so important?
What's he carrying?

1100
01:37:03,581 -- 01:37:06,709
The technical readouts
of that battle station.

1101
01:37:06,792 -- 01:37:10,087
I only hope that when the data's
analysed a weakness can be found.

1102
01:37:10,171 -- 01:37:13,549
- It's not over yet.
- It is for me, sister.

1103
01:37:13,632 -- 01:37:15,343
Look, I ain't in this
for your revolution,

1104
01:37:15,426 -- 01:37:17,136
and I'm not in it for you, Princess.

1105
01:37:17,219 -- 01:37:19,972
I expect to be well paid.
I'm in it for the money.

1106
01:37:20,222 -- 01:37:22,266
You needn't worry about your reward.

1107
01:37:22,350 -- 01:37:25,269
If money is all that you love,
then that's what you'll receive.

1108
01:37:28,439 -- 01:37:30,358
Your friend is quite a mercenary.

1109
01:37:30,441 -- 01:37:33,694
I wonder if he really cares
about anything or anybody.

1110
01:37:34,945 -- 01:37:36,447
I care.

1111
01:37:42,411 -- 01:37:44,538
So...

1112
01:37:45,081 -- 01:37:46,832
What do you think of her, Han?

1113
01:37:46,916 -- 01:37:48,501
I'm trying not to, kid.

1114
01:37:49,627 -- 01:37:50,628
Good.

1115
01:37:54,548 -- 01:37:56,884
Still, she's got a lot of spirit.

1116
01:37:59,553 -- 01:38:02,139
What do you think? You think
a princess and a guy like me...

1117
01:38:02,223 -- 01:38:03,224
No.

1118
01:38:50,646 -- 01:38:53,691
You're safe. When we heard about
Alderaan, we feared the worst.

1119
01:38:53,774 -- 01:38:55,693
We have no time for sorrows,
Commander.

1120
01:38:55,776 -- 01:38:58,779
You must use the information
in this R2 unit to help plan the attack.

1121
01:38:58,863 -- 01:39:00,865
It's our only hope.

1122
01:39:21,969 -- 01:39:22,970
Yes.

1123
01:39:23,053 -- 01:39:24,680
iWe're approaching the planet Yavin./i

1124
01:39:24,763 -- 01:39:27,099
iThe rebel base is on a moon
on the far side./i

1125
01:39:27,183 -- 01:39:29,185
iWe are preparing to orbit the planet./i

1126
01:39:38,194 -- 01:39:40,279
The battle station is heavily shielded

1127
01:39:40,362 -- 01:39:43,824
and carries a firepower
greater than half the starfleet.

1128
01:39:44,533 -- 01:39:48,621
Its defences are designed around
a direct large-scale assault.

1129
01:39:49,246 -- 01:39:53,918
A small, one-man fighter should be able
to penetrate the outer defence.

1130
01:39:55,711 -- 01:39:56,795
Pardon me for asking, sir,

1131
01:39:56,879 -- 01:39:59,507
but what good are snub fighters
against that?

1132
01:39:59,590 -- 01:40:04,178
The Empire doesn't consider a small,
one-man fighter to be any threat

1133
01:40:04,261 -- 01:40:06,931
or they'd have a tighter defence.

1134
01:40:07,097 -- 01:40:10,392
An analysis of the plans
provided by Princess Leia

1135
01:40:10,476 -- 01:40:13,562
has demonstrated a weakness
in the battle station.

1136
01:40:14,396 -- 01:40:16,398
The approach will not be easy.

1137
01:40:17,024 -- 01:40:19,610
You're required to manoeuvre
straight down this trench

1138
01:40:19,693 -- 01:40:22,321
and skim the surface to this point.

1139
01:40:23,155 -- 01:40:25,908
The target area is only two metres wide.

1140
01:40:26,075 -- 01:40:29,662
It's a small thermal exhaust port
right below the main port.

1141
01:40:31,205 -- 01:40:34,083
The shaft leads directly
to the reactor system.

1142
01:40:34,166 -- 01:40:36,919
A precise hit will start
a chain reaction

1143
01:40:37,002 -- 01:40:39,213
which should destroy the station.

1144
01:40:39,296 -- 01:40:42,841
Only a precise hit will
set up a chain reaction.

1145
01:40:42,925 -- 01:40:46,095
The shaft is ray-shielded,
so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.

1146
01:40:46,595 -- 01:40:48,347
That's impossible, even for a computer.

1147
01:40:48,430 -- 01:40:49,640
But it's not impossible.

1148
01:40:49,723 -- 01:40:52,226
I used to bull's-eye
womp rats in my T-16 back home.

1149
01:40:52,309 -- 01:40:54,728
They're not much bigger
than two metres.

1150
01:40:54,812 -- 01:40:57,982
Then man your ships,
and may the Force be with you.

1151
01:41:06,240 -- 01:41:08,826
iOrbiting the planet
at maximum velocity./i

1152
01:41:09,493 -- 01:41:13,205
iThe moon with the rebel base
will be in range in 30 minutes./i

1153
01:41:13,455 -- 01:41:15,916
This will be a day long remembered.

1154
01:41:16,000 -- 01:41:18,002
It has seen the end of Kenobi

1155
01:41:18,085 -- 01:41:21,130
and will soon see
the end of the rebellion.

1156
01:41:26,427 -- 01:41:29,680
iAll flight crews,
man your stations./i

1157
01:41:30,055 -- 01:41:32,558
iAll flight crews, man your stations./i

1158
01:41:35,144 -- 01:41:38,272
So, you got your reward
and you're just leaving, then?

1159
01:41:38,355 -- 01:41:40,357
That's right. Yeah.

1160
01:41:41,442 -- 01:41:44,069
I got some old debts
I gotta pay off with this stuff.

1161
01:41:44,153 -- 01:41:46,322
Even if I didn't,
you don't think I'd be fool enough

1162
01:41:46,405 -- 01:41:48,616
to stick around here, do ya?

1163
01:41:48,699 -- 01:41:50,034
Why don't you come with us?

1164
01:41:50,117 -- 01:41:52,077
You're pretty good in a fight.
We could use ya.

1165
01:41:52,161 -- 01:41:55,039
Come on.
Why don't you take a look around?

1166
01:41:55,122 -- 01:41:57,791
You know what's about to happen,
what they're up against.

1167
01:41:57,875 -- 01:42:01,003
They could use a good pilot like you.
You're turning your back on them.

1168
01:42:01,295 -- 01:42:03,464
What good's a reward
if you ain't around to use it?

1169
01:42:03,672 -- 01:42:06,508
Besides, attacking that battle station
ain't my idea of courage.

1170
01:42:06,592 -- 01:42:09,178
It's more like suicide.

1171
01:42:11,013 -- 01:42:13,849
All right.
Well, take care of yourself, Han.

1172
01:42:13,932 -- 01:42:16,602
I guess that's what you're best at,
isn't it?

1173
01:42:16,977 -- 01:42:18,020
Hey, Luke.

1174
01:42:21,357 -- 01:42:23,734
May the Force be with you.

1175
01:42:26,987 -- 01:42:28,197
Argh!

1176
01:42:30,240 -- 01:42:33,869
What are you looking at?
I know what I'm doing.

1177
01:42:37,956 -- 01:42:40,334
iAll pilots to your stations./i

1178
01:42:41,502 -- 01:42:43,462
iAll pilots to your stations./i

1179
01:42:48,967 -- 01:42:51,512
- What's wrong?
- Oh, it's Han.

1180
01:42:51,595 -- 01:42:54,098
I don't know.
I really thought he'd change his mind.

1181
01:42:54,181 -- 01:42:57,726
He's got to follow his own path.
No one can choose it for him.

1182
01:42:58,727 -- 01:43:01,522
I only wish Ben were here.

1183
01:43:09,196 -- 01:43:12,116
iOpen main launch tubes./i

1184
01:43:12,199 -- 01:43:14,118
iMain launch tubes opening, sir./i

1185
01:43:14,201 -- 01:43:15,869
Hey, Luke!

1186
01:43:15,953 -- 01:43:19,164
- Biggs!
- I don't believe it. How are ya?

1187
01:43:19,248 -- 01:43:21,333
- Coming up?
- I'll be up there with you.

1188
01:43:21,417 -- 01:43:23,961
- Have I got stories to tell you.
- Skywalker.

1189
01:43:25,379 -- 01:43:27,005
Are you sure you can handle this ship?

1190
01:43:27,089 -- 01:43:30,926
Sir, Luke is the best bush pilot
in the outer-rim territories.

1191
01:43:31,552 -- 01:43:34,054
- You'll do all right.
- Thank you, sir. I'll try.

1192
01:43:34,138 -- 01:43:38,058
Gotta get aboard. We'll hear all your
stories when we get back, all right?

1193
01:43:38,142 -- 01:43:40,894
Hey, Biggs.
I told you I'd make it someday.

1194
01:43:40,978 -- 01:43:43,981
It'll be like old times, Luke.
They'll never stop us.

1195
01:43:44,481 -- 01:43:45,482
iStand clear./i

1196
01:43:46,859 -- 01:43:49,778
This R2 unit of yours seems
a bit beat up. You want a new one?

1197
01:43:50,154 -- 01:43:53,031
Not on your life. That little droid
and I have been through a lot.

1198
01:43:53,115 -- 01:43:54,158
You okay, R2?

1199
01:43:55,784 -- 01:43:57,202
Good.

1200
01:43:58,245 -- 01:44:01,582
iGold squadron,
begin take-off procedure./i

1201
01:44:01,665 -- 01:44:04,668
Hang on tight, R2.
You've got to come back.

1202
01:44:06,336 -- 01:44:08,547
You wouldn't want my life
to get boring, would you?

1203
01:44:57,346 -- 01:45:00,349
iLuke,
the Force will be with you./i

1204
01:45:12,152 -- 01:45:15,447
iStandby alert.
Death Star approaching./i

1205
01:45:15,531 -- 01:45:18,700
iEstimated time to firing range,
15 minutes./i

1206
01:45:31,797 -- 01:45:34,049
- All wings report in.
- Red 10 standing by.

1207
01:45:34,132 -- 01:45:36,385
- iRed Seven standing by./i
- Red Three standing by.

1208
01:45:36,468 -- 01:45:39,221
- Red Six standing by.
- iRed Nine standing by./i

1209
01:45:39,304 -- 01:45:41,348
- Red Two standing by.
- iRed 11 standing by./i

1210
01:45:41,431 -- 01:45:43,392
Red Five standing by.

1211
01:45:44,726 -- 01:45:46,645
Lock S-foils in attack position.

1212
01:45:50,899 -- 01:45:52,901
iWe're passing
through the magnetic field./i

1213
01:45:52,985 -- 01:45:55,779
Hold tight. Switch your deflectors on.

1214
01:45:55,863 -- 01:45:57,322
iDouble front./i

1215
01:46:00,325 -- 01:46:01,827
Look at the size of that thing.

1216
01:46:01,910 -- 01:46:04,746
Cut the chatter, Red Two.
Accelerate to attack speed.

1217
01:46:08,208 -- 01:46:10,961
- This is it, boys.
- Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.

1218
01:46:11,044 -- 01:46:13,922
i- I copy, Gold Leader./i
- We're starting for the target shaft.

1219
01:46:14,006 -- 01:46:17,467
We're in position. I'm going to cut
across the axis and draw their fire.

1220
01:46:31,899 -- 01:46:35,193
- iHeavy fire, boss, 23 degrees./i
- iI see it. Stay low./i

1221
01:46:42,618 -- 01:46:44,161
This is Red Five. I'm going in.

1222
01:46:48,707 -- 01:46:49,708
iLuke, pull up!/i

1223
01:46:51,627 -- 01:46:53,712
- You all right?
- A little cooked, but I'm okay.

1224
01:46:59,676 -- 01:47:01,386
We count 30 rebel ships, Lord Vader,

1225
01:47:01,470 -- 01:47:03,722
but they're so small
they're evading our turbolasers.

1226
01:47:03,805 -- 01:47:05,599
We'll have to destroy them ship to ship.

1227
01:47:05,682 -- 01:47:07,809
Get the crews to their fighters.

1228
01:47:10,354 -- 01:47:12,230
Watch yourself. There's a lot of fire

1229
01:47:12,314 -- 01:47:14,566
coming from
the right side of that deflection tower.

1230
01:47:14,650 -- 01:47:15,651
I'm on it.

1231
01:47:15,734 -- 01:47:19,154
- I'm going in. Cover me, Porkins.
- Right with you, Red Three.

1232
01:47:25,494 -- 01:47:27,287
I've got a problem here.

1233
01:47:27,371 -- 01:47:28,789
- Eject.
- I can hold it.

1234
01:47:28,872 -- 01:47:31,041
- Pull up!
- No, I'm all right...

1235
01:47:35,212 -- 01:47:38,840
iThe rebel base will be in
firing range in seven minutes./i

1236
01:47:42,052 -- 01:47:44,972
iLuke, trust your feelings./i

1237
01:47:52,854 -- 01:47:54,481
Squad leaders,

1238
01:47:54,564 -- 01:47:56,692
we've picked up a new group of signals.

1239
01:47:56,775 -- 01:47:58,360
Enemy fighters coming your way.

1240
01:47:58,443 -- 01:48:00,153
My scope's negative.
I don't see anything.

1241
01:48:00,237 -- 01:48:02,447
- Pick up your visual scanning.
- iHere they come./i

1242
01:48:05,701 -- 01:48:07,411
Watch it! You've got one on your tail.

1243
01:48:12,749 -- 01:48:13,834
I'm hit!

1244
01:48:15,085 -- 01:48:17,629
- You've picked one up. Watch it.
- I can't see it.

1245
01:48:19,631 -- 01:48:21,383
He's on me tight. I can't shake him.

1246
01:48:23,301 -- 01:48:25,387
I'll be right there.

1247
01:48:37,274 -- 01:48:40,736
Several fighters have broken off
from the main group. Come with me.

1248
01:48:44,156 -- 01:48:47,284
- iFall in. Fall in./i
- iWatch your back, Luke./i

1249
01:48:47,367 -- 01:48:49,578
iWatch your back!
Fighters above you, coming in./i

1250
01:48:55,959 -- 01:48:58,712
I'm hit, but not bad.
R2, see what you can do with it.

1251
01:48:58,795 -- 01:49:00,964
iHang on back there./i

1252
01:49:01,590 -- 01:49:03,717
iRed Six, can you see Red Five?/i

1253
01:49:03,800 -- 01:49:06,261
iThere's a heavy fire zone.
Red Five, where are you?/i

1254
01:49:06,636 -- 01:49:08,096
I can't shake him.

1255
01:49:11,767 -- 01:49:13,310
I'm on him, Luke.

1256
01:49:16,521 -- 01:49:18,148
Blast it, Biggs. Where are you?

1257
01:49:25,405 -- 01:49:27,949
- Thanks, Wedge.
- iGood shooting, Wedge./i

1258
01:49:28,033 -- 01:49:31,161
Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.
We're starting our attack run.

1259
01:49:32,996 -- 01:49:35,373
iI copy, Gold Leader.
Move into position./i

1260
01:49:37,793 -- 01:49:40,087
Stay in attack formation.

1261
01:49:40,170 -- 01:49:42,923
The exhaust port
is marked and locked in.

1262
01:49:48,887 -- 01:49:52,057
Switch all power
to front deflector screen.

1263
01:49:52,140 -- 01:49:55,352
Switch all power
to front deflector screen.

1264
01:50:00,065 -- 01:50:01,817
How many guns do you think,
Gold Five?

1265
01:50:01,900 -- 01:50:05,153
iSay about 20 guns, some on
the surface, some on the towers./i

1266
01:50:05,237 -- 01:50:08,073
iDeath Star will be in range
in five minutes./i

1267
01:50:10,200 -- 01:50:13,245
Switch to targeting computer.

1268
01:50:15,705 -- 01:50:17,707
Computer's locked. Getting a signal.

1269
01:50:20,043 -- 01:50:22,212
The guns. They've stopped.

1270
01:50:23,922 -- 01:50:26,675
Stabilise your rear deflectors.
Watch for enemy fighters.

1271
01:50:26,758 -- 01:50:29,010
They're coming in. Three marks at 210.

1272
01:50:31,263 -- 01:50:33,181
I'll take them myself. Cover me.

1273
01:50:33,265 -- 01:50:34,558
Yes, sir.

1274
01:50:49,030 -- 01:50:51,533
- It's no good. I can't manoeuvre.
- Stay on target.

1275
01:50:51,616 -- 01:50:53,535
- We're too close.
- Stay on target.

1276
01:50:55,287 -- 01:50:56,288
Loosen up!

1277
01:50:59,249 -- 01:51:02,127
Gold Five to Red Leader,
lost Tiree, lost Hutch.

1278
01:51:02,210 -- 01:51:04,588
- I copy, Gold Leader.
- They came from behind.

1279
01:51:10,927 -- 01:51:13,555
We've analysed their attack, sir,
and there is a danger.

1280
01:51:13,638 -- 01:51:15,557
Should I have your ship standing by?

1281
01:51:15,640 -- 01:51:18,518
Evacuate? In our moment of triumph?

1282
01:51:18,602 -- 01:51:21,104
I think you overestimate their chances.

1283
01:51:21,771 -- 01:51:23,815
iRebel base,
three minutes and closing./i

1284
01:51:24,816 -- 01:51:26,443
Red boys, this is Red Leader.

1285
01:51:26,526 -- 01:51:28,236
iRendezvous at mark 6. 1./i

1286
01:51:28,320 -- 01:51:30,071
iThis is Red Two
flying toward you./i

1287
01:51:30,155 -- 01:51:32,115
iRed Three standing by./i

1288
01:51:32,199 -- 01:51:33,909
Red Leader, this is Base One.

1289
01:51:33,992 -- 01:51:36,661
iKeep half your group out of range
for the next run./i

1290
01:51:36,745 -- 01:51:39,372
iCopy, Base One.
Luke, take Red Two and Three./i

1291
01:51:39,456 -- 01:51:42,792
Hold up here and wait for
my signal to start your run.

1292
01:51:51,426 -- 01:51:52,677
This is it.

1293

00:32:45,997 -- 00:32:47,889
I won't let this one become real.

00:32:49,514 -- 00:32:51,514
This baby will change our lives.

441
00:32:52,850 -- 00:32:55,507
I doubt the queen will continue to
allow me to serve in the senate.

442
00:32:55,532 -- 00:32:58,178
And if the council discovers you're
the father, you'll be expelled-

443
00:32:58,179 -- 00:32:59,194
I know, I know.

444
00:33:01,514 -- 00:33:04,538
Do you think Obi-Wan
might be able to help us?

445
00:33:06,585 -- 00:33:07,725
We don't need his help.

446
00:33:10,225 -- 00:33:12,663

Premonitions. Hmm.

449
00:33:33,468 -- 00:33:35,632
These visions you have.

450
00:33:37,234 -- 00:33:40,108
They're of pain, suffering.

Yourself you speak of,
or someone you know?

00:33:50,311 -- 00:33:51,366
Someone.

454
00:33:52,554 -- 00:33:53,967
Close to you?

455
00:33:55,279 -- 00:33:56,288
Yes.

456
00:33:57,561 -- 00:34:01,757
Careful you must be when
sensing the future, Anakin.

457

The fear of loss is a
path to the dark side.

come true, Master Yoda.

They are going very well.

Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos
has moved his troops to Boz Pity.

What's wrong, then?

473
00:35:08,990 -- 00:35:13,490
The senate is expected to vote more
executive powers to the chancellor today.

474
00:35:14,287 -- 00:35:17,997
Well, that can only mean less deliberating
and more action. Is that bad?

us to end this war.

- ANAKIN: What for?
- OBI-WAN: He would not say.

480
00:35:33,623 -- 00:35:35,349
He didn't inform the council?

481

That's unusual, isn't it?

482
00:35:37,239 -- 00:35:38,747
All of this is unusual.

483
00:35:39,553 -- 00:35:41,553
And it's making me feel uneasy.

484
00:35:57,268 -- 00:35:59,171
I hope you trust me, Anakin.

485
00:35:59,968 -- 00:36:00,976
Of course.

I'm depending on you.

I'm appointing you
to be my personal

representative on
the Jedi Council.

495
00:36:25,265 -- 00:36:27,694
Me? A master?

I'm overwhelmed, sir.

00:36:33,728 -- 00:36:36,681
But the council elects its own members.
They'll never accept this.

I think they will.

499
00:36:38,689 -- 00:36:39,892

by Chancellor Palpatine.

505

I understand.

Your on this council.

507
00:37:07,196 -- 00:37:09,228
But we do not grant you
the rank of master.

508
00:37:10,837 -- 00:37:11,845
What?

509
00:37:17,463 -- 00:37:20,408
How can you do this?
This is outrageous.

510
00:37:21,150 -- 00:37:22,259
It's unfair.

511
00:37:24,016 -- 00:37:27,033
How can you be on the council
and not be a master?

512
00:37:27,971 -- 00:37:30,611
Take a seat, Young Skywalker.

513
00:37:33,931 -- 00:37:35,101
Forgive me, Master.

KI-ADI-MUNDI: We have surveyed
all systems in the Republic,

515
00:37:43,280 -- 00:37:45,874
but have found no sign
of General Grievous.

516
00:37:46,195 -- 00:37:49,038
Hiding in the outer
rim Grievous is.

517

The outlying systems
you must sweep.

518
00:37:52,469 -- 00:37:54,469
We do not have
many ships to spare.

519
00:37:54,687 -- 00:37:56,687
What about the droid
attack on the Wookiees?

520
00:37:57,945 -- 00:38:00,468
WINDU: It is critical we send an
attack group there immediately.

521
00:38:00,664 -- 00:38:04,023
He's right. It's a system
we cannot afford to lose.

00:38:05,437 -- 00:38:06,695
Go, I will.

523
00:38:07,836 -- 00:38:10,398
Good relations with
the Wookiees I have.

524
00:38:11,289 -- 00:38:12,499
It's settled in.

525
00:38:13,124 -- 00:38:17,085
Yoda will take a battalion of clones
to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk.

526
00:38:18,007 -- 00:38:19,507
May the Force be with us all.

ANAKIN: What kind of
nonsense this is?

528
00:38:24,694 -- 00:38:26,835
Put me on the council and
not make me a master?

529
00:38:27,374 -- 00:38:29,257
It's never been done in
the history of the Jedi.

530

- It's insulting.
- Oh, calm down, Anakin.

You have been given
a great honor.

532

To be on the council at your
age- it's never happened before.

533
00:38:37,343 -- 00:38:40,406
The fact of the matter is you are
too close to the chancellor.

534
00:38:40,680 -- 00:38:44,359
The council doesn't like it when
he interferes in Jedi affairs.

535
00:38:44,913 -- 00:38:47,906
I swear to you, I didn't ask
to be put on the council.

536
00:38:47,930 -- 00:38:49,359
But it's what you wanted.

537
00:38:50,491 -- 00:38:53,640
Your friendship with Chancellor
Palpatine seems to have paid off.

538
00:38:54,054 -- 00:38:55,718
That has nothing to do with this.

539
00:38:56,070 -- 00:38:58,945
The only reason the council
has approved your appointment...

540
00:38:58,946 -- 00:39:01,279
is because the
chancellor trusts you.

541
00:39:02,232 -- 00:39:03,286
And?

542
00:39:03,981 -- 00:39:06,943
Anakin, I am on your side. I didn't
want to put you in this situation.

543
00:39:07,084 -- 00:39:08,232
What situation?

544
00:39:12,544 -- 00:39:16,364
The council wants you to report
on all the chancellor's dealings.

545
00:39:16,802 -- 00:39:18,310
They want to know
what he's up to.

546
00:39:23,795 -- 00:39:25,685
ANAKIN: They want me to
spy on the chancellor.

547
00:39:26,802 -- 00:39:28,966
- But that's treason.
- OBI-WAN: We are at war, Anakin.

548
00:39:31,583 -- 00:39:34,497
Why didn't the council give me this
assignment when we were in session?

549
00:39:34,646 -- 00:39:36,880
This assignment does
not to be on record.

550
00:39:38,028 -- 00:39:40,357
The chancellor is not
a bad man, Obi-Wan.

551
00:39:41,115 -- 00:39:44,075
He befriended me. He's watched out
for me ever since I arrived here.

552
00:39:44,161 -- 00:39:45,818
That is why you must help us.

Anakin.

554
00:39:47,761 -- 00:39:50,404
Our allegiance is to the senate,
not to its leader,

555
00:39:50,405 -- 00:39:53,607
who has managed to stay in office
long after his term has expired.

556
00:39:53,967 -- 00:39:55,794
The senate demanded
that he stay longer.

557
00:39:55,856 -- 00:39:58,747
Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin.
Something is out of place.

against the Jedi code,

against the Republic,
against a mentor and a friend.

561

Why are you asking this of me?

The council is asking you.

564
00:40:23,154 -- 00:40:26,599
Anakin did not take to his new
assignment with much enthusiasm.

565

WINDU: It's very dangerous,
putting them together.

566
00:40:30,700 -- 00:40:32,552
I don't think the boy
could handle it.

567
00:40:33,560 -- 00:40:34,607
I don't trust him.

568
00:40:35,740 -- 00:40:38,833
With all due respect, Master,
is he not the chosen one?

569
00:40:40,200 -- 00:40:43,411
Is he not to destroy the Sith
and bring balance to the Force?

570
00:40:44,232 -- 00:40:45,661
So the prophecy says.

571
00:40:46,458 -- 00:40:51,013
YODA: A prophecy that
misread could have been.

572

He never has.

happening to the Jedi order.

I think this war is destroying
the principles of the Republic.

Have you ever considered that
we may be on the wrong side?

What do you mean?

579
00:41:40,951 -- 00:41:44,138
What if the democracy we thought
we were serving no longer exists,

580
00:41:44,646 -- 00:41:48,200
and the Republic has become the very
evil we've been fighting to destroy?

581
00:41:49,012 -- 00:41:52,622
I don't believe that. And you're
sounding like a separatist.

582
00:41:54,527 -- 00:41:57,168
This war represents a
failure to listen.

583
00:41:57,684 -- 00:41:59,583
Now you're closer to the
chancellor than anyone.

584
00:41:59,615 -- 00:42:02,857
Please, ask him to stop the
fighting and let diplomacy resume.

585
00:42:03,623 -- 00:42:05,200
Don't ask me to do that.

Make a motion in the senate, where
that kind of a request belongs.

- Nothing.

Don't do this. Don't shut me out.
Let me help you.

was nothing but our love.

monster and end this war.

I would worry about the collective
wisdom of the council...

for this assignment.

have come to suspect.

613
00:44:19,759 -- 00:44:23,392

control of the Republic.

614

in them has been shaken.

622
00:44:59,150 -- 00:45:02,884

made you feel dishonest, didn't they?

623

power for good.

630
00:45:30,985 -- 00:45:32,961
Good is a point of view, Anakin.

631
00:45:33,539 -- 00:45:38,532
The Sith and the Jedi are
similar in almost every way,

632
00:45:40,189 -- 00:45:42,813
including their quest
for greater power.

633
00:45:44,680 -- 00:45:47,132
The Sith rely on their
passion for their strength.

634
00:45:47,875 -- 00:45:50,368
They think inwards only about themselves.

635
00:45:51,829 -- 00:45:53,524
And the Jedi don't.

636

- No.
- I thought not.

640

It's not a story the
Jedi would tell you.

641
00:46:24,463 -- 00:46:26,052
It's a Sith legend.

642

Darth Plagueis...

643
00:46:29,084 -- 00:46:34,349
was a dark lord of the Sith
so powerful and so wise,

644
00:46:34,693 -- 00:46:39,231
he could use the Force to
influence the midi-chlorians...

645
00:46:39,606 -- 00:46:42,724
to create life.

646
00:46:44,396 -- 00:46:47,395
He had such a knowledge
of the dark side,

647
00:46:48,028 -- 00:46:52,216
he could even keep the
ones he cared about...

648
00:46:53,349 -- 00:46:54,559
from dying.

649
00:46:59,020 -- 00:47:02,653
He could actually...
save people from death?

650
00:47:03,724 -- 00:47:08,302
The dark side of the Force is the
path way to many abilities...

00:47:16,534 -- 00:47:18,869
He became so powerful,

654
00:47:19,971 -- 00:47:21,971
the only thing he was afraid of was...

655
00:47:23,768 -- 00:47:25,166
losing his power.

656
00:47:25,262 -- 00:47:27,262
Which eventually, of course, he did.

657
00:47:28,567 -- 00:47:33,643
Unfortunately, he taught his
apprentice everything he knew.

658
00:47:34,564 -- 00:47:37,142
Then his apprentice
killed him in his sleep.

659
00:47:40,322 -- 00:47:41,401
It's ironic.

660
00:47:42,377 -- 00:47:47,424
He could save others from
death but not himself.

661

learn this power?

199

00:22:00,611 -- 00:22:02,570
Roger, roger.

268
00:22:42,862 -- 00:22:45,447
Whoops!

269
00:22:45,531 -- 00:22:47,991
[JarJar ]
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

270
00:22:57,084 -- 00:23:01,087
- We should leave the street, Your Highness.
- Get theirweapons.

271
00:23:01,172 -- 00:23:04,716
Whoa! Yousa guys bombad!

272
00:23:06,802 -- 00:23:09,220
We're ambassadors for the supreme chancellor.

273
00:23:09,305 -- 00:23:11,222
Your negotiations seemed to have failed, Ambassador.

274
00:23:11,307 -- 00:23:13,141
The negotiations never took place.

275
00:23:13,225 -- 00:23:15,643
It's urgent that we make contact
with the Republic.

276
00:23:15,728 -- 00:23:19,189
- They've knocked out all our communications.
- Do you have transports?

277
00:23:19,273 -- 00:23:21,733
In the main hangar. This way.

278
00:23:26,238 -- 00:23:29,407
- There are too many ofthem.
- That won't be a problem.

279
00:23:29,492 -- 00:23:33,036
Your Highness, under the circumstances,
I suggest you come to Coruscant with us.

280
00:23:33,120 -- 00:23:36,247
Thankyou, Ambassador,
but my place is with my people.

281
00:23:36,332 -- 00:23:39,083
-They will kill you ifyou stay.
-They wouldn't dare.

282
00:23:39,168 -- 00:23:42,921
They need her to sign a treaty
to make this invasion legal.
They can't afford to kill her.

283
00:23:43,005 -- 00:23:45,173
There is something else behind all this,
Your Highness.

284
00:23:45,257 -- 00:23:47,258
There's no logic in the Federation's move here.

285
00:23:47,343 -- 00:23:49,302
My feelings tell me they will destroyyou.

286
00:23:49,386 -- 00:23:51,846
Our only hope is for the senate to side with us.

287
00:23:51,931 -- 00:23:54,390
Senator Palpatine will need your help.

288
00:23:54,475 -- 00:23:58,520
Either choice presents great danger... to us all.

289
00:23:58,604 -- 00:24:00,522
We are brave, Your Highness.

290
00:24:00,606 -- 00:24:03,858
Ifyou are to leave, Your Highness, it must be now.

291
00:24:03,943 -- 00:24:06,444
Then I will plead our case to the senate.

292
00:24:06,529 -- 00:24:09,322
Be careful, Governor.

293
00:24:18,207 -- 00:24:21,417
We'll need to free those pilots.

294
00:24:21,502 -- 00:24:23,461
I'll deal with that.

295
00:24:26,882 -- 00:24:29,384
Halt!
I'm ambassador to
the supreme chancellor.

296
00:24:29,468 -- 00:24:31,469
I'm taking these people to Coruscant.

297
00:24:31,554 -- 00:24:34,806
- Where are you taking them?
- To Coruscant.

298
00:24:34,890 -- 00:24:37,559
Coruscant? Uh, that doesn't compute.

299
00:24:37,643 -- 00:24:39,561
Uh, wait. You're under arrest.

300
00:24:44,984 -- 00:24:47,360
Come on. Move!

301
00:24:51,615 -- 00:24:54,242
Go!

302
00:25:18,142 -- 00:25:21,477
Now, stay here and keep out oftrouble.

303
00:25:25,232 -- 00:25:28,401
Hello, boyos.
[ Beeping, Whistling ]

304
00:25:33,699 -- 00:25:35,408
There's the blockade.

305
00:25:44,209 -- 00:25:47,420
- [ Alarm Beeping ]
- The shield generator's been hit!

306
00:25:47,504 -- 00:25:50,465
[ Alarm Blaring ]

307
00:25:50,549 -- 00:25:52,842
[ Beeping ]

308
00:25:52,927 -- 00:25:55,803
[ Gasps ]

309
00:25:55,888 -- 00:25:57,513
How wude!

310
00:25:57,598 -- 00:26:01,309
[ Whistling ]

311
00:26:07,524 -- 00:26:09,108
We're losing droids fast.

312
00:26:09,193 -- 00:26:12,612
Ifwe can't get the shield generator fixed,
we'll be sitting ducks.

313
00:26:14,698 -- 00:26:18,826
- The shields are gone.
- [ Whistling, Beeping ]

314
00:26:22,665 -- 00:26:25,458
The power's back!

315
00:26:25,542 -- 00:26:28,127
[ Beeping ]

316
00:26:28,212 -- 00:26:31,756
That little droid did it.
He bypassed the main power drive.

317
00:26:31,840 -- 00:26:34,467
Deflector shields up at maximum.

318
00:26:43,978 -- 00:26:47,730
There's not enough power to get us to Coruscant.
The hyperdrive is leaking.

319
00:26:47,815 -- 00:26:50,733
We'll have to land somewhere
to refuel and repair the ship.

320
00:26:50,818 -- 00:26:53,027
Here, Master. Tatooine.

321
00:26:53,112 -- 00:26:56,739
Small, out ofthe way, poor.
The Trade Federation have no presence there.

322
00:26:56,824 -- 00:26:58,700
How can you be sure?

323
00:26:58,784 -- 00:27:00,743
It's controlled by the Hutts.

324
00:27:00,828 -- 00:27:03,705
You can't take Her Royal Highness there.
The Hutts are gangsters.

325
00:27:03,789 -- 00:27:06,124
- Ifthey discovered her-
- It'd be no different than ifwe landed...

326
00:27:06,208 -- 00:27:08,084
on a system controlled by the Federation,

327
00:27:08,168 -- 00:27:12,547
except that the Hutts aren't looking for her,
which gives us the advantage.

328
00:27:16,969 -- 00:27:20,013
And Queen Amidala, has she signed the treaty?

329
00:27:20,097 -- 00:27:23,808
She has disappeared, my lord.

330
00:27:23,892 -- 00:27:28,062
One Naboo cruiser got past the blockade.

331
00:27:28,147 -- 00:27:31,149
[ Snarls ]
I want that treaty signed.

332
00:27:31,233 -- 00:27:33,317
My lord,

333
00:27:33,402 -- 00:27:35,987
it's impossible to locate the ship.

334
00:27:36,071 -- 00:27:38,322
It's out ofour range.

335
00:27:38,407 -- 00:27:41,159
Not for a Sith.

336
00:27:41,243 -- 00:27:43,161
This is my apprentice,

337
00:27:43,245 -- 00:27:45,204
Darth Maul.

338
00:27:46,457 -- 00:27:49,834
He will find your lost ship.

339
00:27:54,131 -- 00:27:56,466
This is getting out of hand.

340
00:27:56,550 -- 00:27:58,593
Now there are two ofthem.

341
00:27:58,677 -- 00:28:01,763
We should not have made this bargain.

342
00:28:06,977 -- 00:28:10,605
An extremely well-put-together little droid,
Your Highness.

343
00:28:10,689 -- 00:28:13,608
Without a doubt,
it saved the ship, as well as our lives.

344
00:28:13,692 -- 00:28:17,028
It is to be commended. What is its number?

345
00:28:17,112 -- 00:28:19,614
[ Chirping, Beeping ]

346
00:28:19,698 -- 00:28:21,866

347
00:28:21,950 -- 00:28:27,080
- Thankyou, R2-D2.
- [ Happy Chirping ]

349
00:28:30,084 -- 00:28:32,251
Clean this droid up as best you can.

350
00:28:32,336 -- 00:28:34,337
It deserves our gratitude.

351
00:28:34,421 -- 00:28:36,005
[ Whistling ]

352
00:28:36,090 -- 00:28:38,716
Continue, Captain.

353
00:28:39,760 -- 00:28:42,220
Your Highness, with your permission,

354
00:28:42,304 -- 00:28:45,389
we're heading for a remote planet
called Tatooine.

355
00:28:45,474 -- 00:28:48,810
It's in a system far beyond the reach
ofthe Trade Federation.

356
00:28:48,894 -- 00:28:51,562
I do not agree with theJedi on this.

357
00:28:51,647 -- 00:28:54,607
You must trust myjudgment, Your Highness.

358
00:28:55,984 -- 00:28:57,902

00:29:36,191 -- 00:29:39,902
That's it— Tatooine.
There's a settlement.

372
00:29:39,987 -- 00:29:44,157
Land near the outskirts.
We don't want to attract attention.

373
00:30:01,383 -- 00:30:04,218
The hyperdrive generator's gone, Master.
We'll need a new one.

374
00:30:04,303 -- 00:30:06,762
That'll complicate things. Be wary.

375
00:30:06,889 -- 00:30:10,057
I sense a disturbance in the Force.
I feel it also, Master.

376
00:30:10,142 -- 00:30:13,019
Don't let them send any transmissions.

Wait.

380
00:30:28,243 -- 00:30:31,120
Her Highness commands you
to take her handmaiden with you.

381
00:30:31,205 -- 00:30:35,041
No more commands
from Her Highness today, Captain.

382
00:30:35,125 -- 00:30:37,210
The spaceport is not going to be pleasant.

383
00:30:37,294 -- 00:30:39,503
The queen wishes it.

384
00:30:39,588 -- 00:30:41,547
She's curious about the planet.

385
00:30:42,591 -- 00:30:45,134

This is not a good idea.

Moisture farms, for the most part.

Some indigenous tribes and scavengers.

390
00:31:08,909 -- 00:31:13,246
The few spaceports like this one
are havens for those that don't wish to be found.

I was cleaning the fan switches.

Are you an angel?
What?

414
00:32:32,868 -- 00:32:36,620
An angel.
I heard the deep space pilots
talk about them.

415
00:32:36,705 -- 00:32:39,623
They're the most beautiful creatures
in the universe.

416
00:32:39,708 -- 00:32:42,293
They live on the moons of Iego, I think.

417
00:32:42,377 -- 00:32:44,754
You're a funny little boy.

418
00:32:44,838 -- 00:32:46,797
How do you know so much?

419
00:32:46,882 -- 00:32:50,760
I listen to all the traders and star pilots
who come through here.

420
00:32:50,844 -- 00:32:55,139
I'm a pilot, you know, and someday
I'm gonna fly away from this place.

421
00:32:55,265 -- 00:32:59,226
You're a pilot?
Mm-hmm. All my life.

422
00:32:59,311 -- 00:33:01,687
How long have you been here?

423
00:33:01,772 -- 00:33:05,816
Since I was very little. Three, I think.

424
00:33:05,901 -- 00:33:08,652
My mom and I were sold to Gardulla the Hutt,

but she lost us betting on the Podraces.

I'm a person, and my name is Anakin.
I'm sorry.

428
00:33:17,746 -- 00:33:21,499
I don't fully understand.
This is a strange place to me.

609
00:43:29,148 -- 00:43:31,984
Your mother's right.

610
00:43:32,068 -- 00:43:35,195
Is there anyone friendly to the Republic
who can help us?

611
00:43:36,489 -- 00:43:38,407
No.

612
00:43:43,413 -- 00:43:48,041
Mom, you say the biggest problem
in this universe is nobody helps each other.

613
00:43:52,046 -- 00:43:55,799
I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want
to put your son in danger.

614
00:43:55,883 -- 00:43:57,801
We'll find some other way.

615
00:43:57,885 -- 00:44:00,178
No.

616
00:44:00,263 -- 00:44:02,764
There is no other way.

617
00:44:02,849 -- 00:44:07,185
I may not like it, but he can help you.

618
00:44:07,270 -- 00:44:09,896
He was meant to help you.

[ Growling ]

620
00:44:23,494 -- 00:44:25,370
Are you sure about this?

621
00:44:25,455 -- 00:44:28,165
Trusting our fate to a boy we hardly know?

622
00:44:28,249 -- 00:44:30,292
The queen will not approve.

623
00:44:30,376 -- 00:44:33,336
The queen doesn't need to know.

624
00:44:33,421 -- 00:44:35,005
Well, I don't approve.

625
00:44:35,131 -- 00:44:38,842
[ Bell Dings ]
The boy tells me you want to
sponsor him in the race.

626
00:44:38,926 -- 00:44:43,972
How can you do this?
Not on the Republic credits, I think, huh?

627
00:44:44,057 -- 00:44:46,266
My ship will be the entry fee.

628
00:44:46,350 -- 00:44:48,477
Oh, not bad!

629
00:44:48,561 -- 00:44:51,563
Not bad, huh? A Nubian, huh?

630
00:44:51,647 -- 00:44:54,983
It's in good order,
except for the parts I need.

631
00:44:55,068 -- 00:44:57,611
What would the boy ride?

632
00:44:57,695 -- 00:45:01,281
He smashed up my pod in the last race.
It will take some long time to fix it.

633
00:45:01,365 -- 00:45:05,535
It wasn't my fault, really.
Sebulba flashed me with his vents.

634
00:45:05,620 -- 00:45:09,039
I actually saved the pod, mostly.

635
00:45:09,123 -- 00:45:12,626
Mmm. That you did, huh.
[ chuckling ]

636
00:45:12,710 -- 00:45:15,545
The boy's good. No doubts there, huh?

637
00:45:15,630 -- 00:45:19,966
I have acquired a pod in a game ofchance,
the fastest ever built.

638
00:45:20,051 -- 00:45:25,180
I hope you didn't kill anyone I know for it, huh?

639
00:45:25,264 -- 00:45:27,057
[ Laughing ]

640
00:45:27,141 -- 00:45:30,227
So, you supply the pod and the entry fee,

641
00:45:30,311 -- 00:45:32,229
and I supply the boy.

642
00:45:32,313 -- 00:45:36,233
We split the winnings,
um, 50-50, I think, huh?

643
00:45:36,317 -- 00:45:40,987
If it's going to be 50-50,
I suggest you front the cash for the entry.

644
00:45:41,072 -- 00:45:43,156
Ifwe win,

645
00:45:43,241 -- 00:45:47,077
you keep all the winnings,
minus the cost ofthe parts I need.

646
00:45:47,161 -- 00:45:50,413
And ifwe lose, you keep my ship.

647
00:45:51,666 -- 00:45:54,251
Either way, you win.

648

[ Grumbling continues ]

650
00:46:00,049 -- 00:46:02,384
Deal!

651
00:46:07,181 -- 00:46:10,851
[ Huttese ]
Your friend is a foolish one, methinks.

652
00:46:18,776 -- 00:46:21,778
What ifthis plan fails, Master?

653
00:46:21,863 -- 00:46:24,614
We could be stuck here a very long time.

654
00:46:24,699 -- 00:46:27,242
Well, it's too dangerous
to call for help,

655
00:46:27,326 -- 00:46:30,787
and a ship without a power supply
isn't going to get us anywhere.

656
00:46:30,872 -- 00:46:32,873
And...

657
00:46:32,957 -- 00:46:35,834
there's something about this boy.

658
00:46:40,923 -- 00:46:44,009
You should be very proud ofyour son.

659
00:46:44,093 -- 00:46:47,137
He gives without any thought of reward.

660
00:46:47,221 -- 00:46:50,098
Well, he knows nothing of greed.

661
00:46:50,224 -- 00:46:54,186
He has a—
He has special powers.

662
00:46:55,313 -- 00:46:57,189
Yes.

663
00:46:57,273 -- 00:46:59,983
He can see things before they happen.

664
00:47:00,067 -- 00:47:02,903
That's why he appears to have such quick reflexes.

665
00:47:02,987 -- 00:47:04,863
It's aJedi trait.

666
00:47:04,989 -- 00:47:07,824
He deserves better than a slave's life.
Why, certainly.

667
00:47:07,909 -- 00:47:11,286
Had he been born in the Republic,
we would have identified him early.

668
00:47:13,664 -- 00:47:16,333
The Force is unusually strong with him.
That much is clear.

669
00:47:17,418 -- 00:47:19,377
Who was his father?

670
00:47:22,048 -- 00:47:23,965
There was no father.

671
00:47:25,426 -- 00:47:28,762
I carried him, I gave birth, I raised him.

672
00:47:28,846 -- 00:47:32,140
I can't explain what happened.

673
00:47:33,809 -- 00:47:35,602
Can you help him?

674
00:47:35,686 -- 00:47:37,646
I don't know.

675
00:47:40,107 -- 00:47:43,777

on that thing foryears.

01:11:56,312 -- 01:11:59,231
But that's so wonderful, Ani.
And he has been freed.

958
01:11:59,315 -- 01:12:02,109
- What?
- You're no longer a slave.

959
01:12:03,986 -- 01:12:05,946
Did you hear that?

960
01:12:06,030 -- 01:12:09,199
Now you can make your dreams come true, Ani.

961
01:12:09,283 -- 01:12:12,035
You are free.

962
01:12:15,123 -- 01:12:17,040
Will you take him with you?

963
01:12:17,125 -- 01:12:19,459
Is he to become a Jedi?
Yes.

964
01:12:19,544 -- 01:12:21,461
Our meeting was not a coincidence.

965
01:12:21,546 -- 01:12:24,005
Nothing happens by accident.

966
01:12:24,090 -- 01:12:27,676
You mean I get to come with you in your starship?

967
01:12:27,760 -- 01:12:29,678
Anakin,

968
01:12:31,055 -- 01:12:34,391
training to become a Jedi
is not an easy challenge,

969
01:12:34,475 -- 01:12:37,394
and even ifyou succeed, it's a hard life.

970
01:12:37,478 -- 01:12:40,689
But I wanna go.
It's what I've always dreamed ofdoing.

971
01:12:40,773 -- 01:12:43,650
Can I go, Mom?

972
01:12:43,735 -- 01:12:45,986
Anakin,

973
01:12:46,070 -- 01:12:49,322
this path has been placed before you.

974
01:12:49,407 -- 01:12:51,950
The choice is yours alone.

975
01:12:55,538 -- 01:12:57,456
I wanna do it.

976
01:12:59,000 -- 01:13:01,251
Then packyour things.
We haven't much time.

977
01:13:01,335 -- 01:13:03,462
Yippee!

978
01:13:08,551 -- 01:13:10,469
What about Mom?

979
01:13:13,556 -- 01:13:15,474
Is she free too?

980
01:13:15,558 -- 01:13:19,102
I tried to free your mother, Ani,
but Watto wouldn't have it.

981
01:13:19,187 -- 01:13:22,147
You're coming with us, aren't you, Mom?

982
01:13:29,739 -- 01:13:33,450
Son, my place is here. My future is here.

983
01:13:33,534 -- 01:13:36,953
It is time foryou to let go.

984
01:13:37,038 -- 01:13:39,247
I don't want things to change.

985
01:13:39,332 -- 01:13:41,750
But you can't stop the change...

986
01:13:41,834 -- 01:13:44,920
any more than you can stop the suns from setting.

987
01:13:46,005 -- 01:13:47,923
Oh, I love you.

01:13:53,554 -- 01:13:55,514
Now hurry.

990
01:14:00,520 -- 01:14:02,437
Thankyou.

991
01:14:02,522 -- 01:14:05,440
I'll watch after him. You have my word.

992
01:14:07,401 -- 01:14:10,111
Will you be all right?

993
01:14:10,196 -- 01:14:12,155
Yeah.

994
01:14:14,325 -- 01:14:16,785
Oh! Oh, my. Oh!

995
01:14:16,869 -- 01:14:18,787
Hello, Master Anakin.

996
01:14:18,871 -- 01:14:20,956
Well, 3PO, I've been freed...

997
01:14:21,040 -- 01:14:23,458
and I'm going away in a starship.

998
01:14:23,543 -- 01:14:26,503
Master Anakin,
you are my maker and I wish you well.

999
01:14:26,587 -- 01:14:30,841
However, I should prefer it
if I were a little more completed.

1000
01:14:30,925 -- 01:14:36,304
I'm sorry I wasn't able to finish you, 3PO,
give you coverings and all.

1001
01:14:36,389 -- 01:14:40,350
I'm gonna miss working on you.
You've been a great pal.

1002
01:14:40,434 -- 01:14:43,353
I'll make sure
Mom doesn't sell you or anything.

1003
01:14:43,437 -- 01:14:45,188
Sell me?

1004
01:14:45,273 -- 01:14:46,940
Bye.

1005
01:14:47,024 -- 01:14:48,942
Oh, my.

1006
01:15:12,383 -- 01:15:15,302
I can't do it, Mom. I just can't do it.

1007
01:15:15,386 -- 01:15:18,096
Ani.

1008
01:15:19,390 -- 01:15:21,600
Will I ever see you again?

1009
01:15:23,019 -- 01:15:25,937
What does your heart tell you?

1010
01:15:27,273 -- 01:15:29,524
I hope so.

1011
01:15:29,609 -- 01:15:31,526
Yes.

1012
01:15:31,611 -- 01:15:33,528
I guess.

1013
01:15:33,613 -- 01:15:36,531
Then we will see each other again.

1014
01:15:39,535 -- 01:15:42,454
I will come back and free you, Mom.

1015
01:15:42,538 -- 01:15:44,497
I promise.

1016
01:15:52,340 -- 01:15:55,717
Now, be brave...

1017
01:15:55,801 -- 01:15:58,511
and don't look back.

1018
01:15:58,596 -- 01:16:00,513
Don't look back.

- Qui-Gon, sir, wait! I'm tired!
- Anakin! Drop!

1021
01:16:51,190 -- 01:16:54,150
Go! Tell them to take off!

1022
01:17:07,707 -- 01:17:09,624
Qui-Gon's in trouble.

1023
01:17:09,709 -- 01:17:11,418
Take off.

1024
01:17:12,503 -- 01:17:14,337
Over there. Fly low.

1025

Are you all right?

1026
01:17:37,236 -- 01:17:39,154
I think so.

1027
01:17:39,238 -- 01:17:41,156
What was it?

1028
01:17:41,240 -- 01:17:44,659
I'm not sure,
but it was well-trained in theJedi arts.

1029
01:17:44,744 -- 01:17:47,746
[ Beeps ]
My guess is it was after the queen.

1030
01:17:47,830 -- 01:17:50,373
What are we gonna do about it?

1031

- Hi.
- [ R2-D2 Beeping ]

01:17:59,508 -- 01:18:03,261
You're a Jedi too? Pleased to meet you.

1036
01:18:10,436 -- 01:18:13,354
Your queen is lost, your people are starving,

1037
01:18:13,439 -- 01:18:15,356
and you, Governor, are going to die...

1038
01:18:15,441 -- 01:18:18,359
much sooner than your people, I'm afraid.

1039
01:18:18,444 -- 01:18:20,612
This invasion will gain you nothing.

1040
01:18:20,696 -- 01:18:23,740
We're a democracy. The people have decided.

1041
01:18:23,824 -- 01:18:25,784
Take him away.

1042
01:18:29,163 -- 01:18:32,082
My troops are in position
to begin searching the swamps...

1043
01:18:32,166 -- 01:18:34,584
for these rumored underwater villages.

1044
01:18:34,668 -- 01:18:37,128

[ Muttering, Snoring ]

1046
01:18:48,140 -- 01:18:50,892
The death toll is catastrophic.

1047
01:18:50,976 -- 01:18:53,603
We must bow to their wishes.

1050
01:19:12,081 -- 01:19:14,791

[ Continues Muttering, Snoring ]

1052
01:19:22,758 -- 01:19:25,677
You come from a warm planet, Ani.

1053
01:19:25,761 -- 01:19:28,179
A little too warm for my taste.

1054
01:19:28,264 -- 01:19:30,557
Space is cold.

1055
01:19:30,641 -- 01:19:32,851
You seem sad.

1056
01:19:33,936 -- 01:19:36,271
The queen is worried.

1057
01:19:36,355 -- 01:19:38,731
Her people are suffering, dying.

1058
01:19:38,816 -- 01:19:42,402
She must convince the senate to intervene, or...

1059
01:19:43,863 -- 01:19:46,197
I'm not sure what'll happen.

1060
01:19:47,575 -- 01:19:49,701
I made this foryou...

1061
01:19:51,120 -- 01:19:53,037
so you'd remember me.

1062
01:19:53,122 -- 01:19:56,457
I carved it out ofa japor snippet.

1063
01:19:56,542 -- 01:19:59,377
It'll bring you good fortune.

01:19:59,461 -- 01:20:01,379
It's beautiful.

1065
01:20:01,463 -- 01:20:03,882
But I don't need this to rememberyou by.

1066
01:20:07,511 -- 01:20:10,930
Many things will change
when we reach the capital, Ani,

1067
01:20:11,015 -- 01:20:13,600
but my caring foryou will remain.

1068
01:20:16,270 -- 01:20:19,480
I care foryou, too, only I—

01:20:46,342 -- 01:20:49,636
And look over there.

1073

It is a great gift to see you alive, Your Majesty.

1074
01:21:22,253 -- 01:21:25,088
With the communications breakdown,
we've been very concerned.

May I present Supreme chancellor Valorum.

01:21:30,678 -- 01:21:34,847
Welcome, Your Highness.
It's an honor to finally meet you in person.

1078
01:21:34,932 -- 01:21:37,558
Thankyou, Supreme Chancellor.

1079
01:21:37,643 -- 01:21:40,812
I must relay to you how distressed
everyone is over the current situation.

1080
01:21:40,896 -- 01:21:43,648
I've called for a special session
ofthe senate to hearyour position.

1081
01:21:44,733 -- 01:21:47,652
I'm grateful foryour concern, Chancellor.

1082
01:21:47,736 -- 01:21:49,654
There is a question of procedure,

1083
01:21:49,738 -- 01:21:52,490
but I'm confident we can overcome it.

1084
01:21:52,574 -- 01:21:55,493
I must speak with theJedi Council immediately.

1085
01:21:55,577 -- 01:21:58,454
The situation has become much more complicated.

[ Palpatine ]
There is no civility, only politics.

1091
01:22:55,596 -- 01:22:59,515
The Republic is not what it once was.

1092
01:22:59,600 -- 01:23:04,896
The senate is full ofgreedy,
squabbling delegates.

1093
01:23:04,980 -- 01:23:06,898
There is no interest...

1094
01:23:06,982 -- 01:23:09,108
in the common good.

1095
01:23:09,193 -- 01:23:11,444
I must be frank, Your Majesty.

1096
01:23:11,528 -- 01:23:14,447
There is little chance
the senate will act on the invasion.

1097
01:23:14,531 -- 01:23:17,450
ChancellorValorum
seems to think there is hope.

1098
01:23:17,534 -- 01:23:21,662
If I may say so, Your Majesty,
the chancellor has little real power.

1099
01:23:21,747 -- 01:23:25,625
He is mired by baseless accusations ofcorruption.

1100
01:23:25,751 -- 01:23:29,504
The bureaucrats are in charge now.
What options have we?

1101
01:23:29,588 -- 01:23:33,174
Our best choice would be
to push for the election...

1102
01:23:33,258 -- 01:23:35,176
ofa stronger supreme chancellor,

1103
01:23:35,260 -- 01:23:37,762
one who could control the bureaucrats...

1104
01:23:37,846 -- 01:23:39,722
and give usjustice.

1105
01:23:39,807 -- 01:23:44,102
You could call for a vote of no confidence...

1106
01:23:44,186 -- 01:23:46,104
in chancellor Valorum.

1107
01:23:46,188 -- 01:23:48,731
He has been our strongest supporter.

1108
01:23:48,816 -- 01:23:54,070
Our only other choice
would be to submit a plea to the courts.

1109
01:23:54,154 -- 01:23:57,532
The courts take even longer to decide things
than the senate.

1110
01:23:57,616 -- 01:24:00,535
Our people are dying, Senator.

1111
01:24:00,619 -- 01:24:04,372
We must do something quickly
to stop the Federation.

1112
01:24:04,456 -- 01:24:07,083
To be realistic, Your Majesty,

1113
01:24:07,167 -- 01:24:12,255
I think we're going to have to accept
Federation control for the time being.

1114
01:24:13,966 -- 01:24:16,050
That is something I cannot do.

1115
01:24:23,350 -- 01:24:25,977
He was trained in theJedi arts.

1116
01:24:26,061 -- 01:24:30,022
My only conclusion can be that it was a Sith lord.

1117
01:24:30,107 -- 01:24:34,318
Impossible.
The Sith have been extinct
for a millennium.

1118
01:24:34,403 -- 01:24:38,614
I do not believe the Sith
could have returned without us knowing.

1119
01:24:38,699 -- 01:24:41,826
Ah, hard to see, the dark side is.

1120
01:24:41,910 -- 01:24:44,829
We will use all our resources
to unravel this mystery.

1121
01:24:44,913 -- 01:24:47,957
We will discover the identity
ofyour attacker.

1122
01:24:48,041 -- 01:24:50,001

1125
01:25:00,220 -- 01:25:02,180
With your permission, my master,

1126
01:25:03,640 -- 01:25:06,684
I have encountered a vergence in the Force.

1127
01:25:07,769 -- 01:25:09,812
A vergence, you say?

1128
01:25:09,897 -- 01:25:12,064
Located around a person?

1129
01:25:12,149 -- 01:25:14,066
A boy.

1130
01:25:14,151 -- 01:25:17,987
His cells have the highest concentration
of midi-chlorians I have seen in a life-form.

01:25:18,071 -- 01:25:21,032
It is possible he was conceived
by the midi-chlorians.

1132
01:25:22,659 -- 01:25:25,036
You refer to the prophecy...

1133
01:25:25,120 -- 01:25:27,538
ofthe one who will bring balance to the Force.

1134
01:25:27,623 -- 01:25:29,457
You believe it's this boy?

1135
01:25:29,583 -- 01:25:32,210
I don't presume to—
[ Yoda ]
But you do.

1136
01:25:32,294 -- 01:25:34,962
Revealed your opinion is.

1137
01:25:35,047 -- 01:25:37,089
I request the boy be tested, Master.

1138
01:25:37,174 -- 01:25:42,428
Oh? Trained as a Jedi you request for him, hmm?

1139
01:25:42,513 -- 01:25:45,306
Finding him was the will ofthe Force.

1140
01:25:45,390 -- 01:25:47,350
I have no doubt ofthat.

1141
01:25:50,979 -- 01:25:53,397
[ Sighs ]

1142
01:25:53,482 -- 01:25:56,067
Bring him before us, then.

1143
01:26:06,078 -- 01:26:08,996
[ Beeps ]
The boy's here to see Padmé.

1144
01:26:09,081 -- 01:26:11,040
[ Woman ]
Let him in.

1145
01:26:13,919 -- 01:26:17,838
I'm sorry, Ani,
but Padmé's not here right now.

1146
01:26:17,923 -- 01:26:20,258
Who is it?

1147
01:26:20,342 -- 01:26:23,386
Anakin Skywalker to see Padmé,
Your Highness.

1148
01:26:23,470 -- 01:26:25,388
I've sent Padmé on an errand.

1149
01:26:25,472 -- 01:26:30,393
I'm on my way to theJedi temple
to start my training, I hope.

1150
01:26:30,477 -- 01:26:34,355
I may never see her again,
so I came to say good-bye.

1151
01:26:34,439 -- 01:26:36,357
We will tell her foryou.

1152
01:26:36,441 -- 01:26:39,068
We are sure her heart goes with you.

1153
01:26:39,152 -- 01:26:41,279
Thankyou, Your Highness.

1154
01:26:55,210 -- 01:26:59,338
The chair recognizes the senator
from the sovereign system of Naboo.

1155
01:26:59,423 -- 01:27:02,508
[ Senators Murmuring ]

1156
01:27:06,096 -- 01:27:10,516
[ Palpatine ]
Supreme Chancellor, delegates ofthe senate,

1157
01:27:10,601 -- 01:27:13,019
a tragedy has occurred...

1158
01:27:13,103 -- 01:27:16,647
which started right here
with the taxation oftrade routes...

1159
01:27:16,732 -- 01:27:19,775
and has now engulfed our entire planet...

1160
01:27:19,860 -- 01:27:21,902
in the oppression ofthe Trade Federation.

1161
01:27:21,987 -- 01:27:24,238
This is outrageous!

1162
01:27:24,323 -- 01:27:26,907
I object to the senator's statements.

1163
01:27:26,992 -- 01:27:31,078
The chair does not recognize
the senator from the Trade Federation at this time.

1164
01:27:31,163 -- 01:27:35,082
To state our allegations, I present Queen Amidala,

1165
01:27:35,167 -- 01:27:37,168
recently elected ruler ofthe Naboo,

1166
01:27:37,252 -- 01:27:39,170
who speaks on our behalf.

1167
01:27:39,254 -- 01:27:41,172
[ Murmuring Continues ]

1168
01:27:45,177 -- 01:27:47,928
Honorable representatives ofthe Republic,

1169
01:27:48,013 -- 01:27:51,140
I come to you
under the gravest ofcircumstances.

1170
01:27:51,224 -- 01:27:54,268
The Naboo system has been invaded
by the droid armies ofthe Trade—

1171
01:27:54,353 -- 01:27:57,813
I object! There is no proof!

1172
01:27:57,898 -- 01:27:59,815
This is incredible.

1173
01:27:59,900 -- 01:28:03,986
We recommend a commission be sent to Naboo
to ascertain the truth.

1174
01:28:04,071 -- 01:28:06,322
The congress of Malastare concurs...

1175
01:28:06,406 -- 01:28:09,241
with the honorable delegate
from the Trade Federation.

1176
01:28:09,326 -- 01:28:11,744
A commission must be appointed.
The point—

1177
01:28:11,828 -- 01:28:14,997
Excuse me, Chancellor.
[ Palpatine ]
Enter the bureaucrat.

1178
01:28:15,082 -- 01:28:17,792
The true rulers ofthe Republic.

1179
01:28:17,876 -- 01:28:22,046
And on the payroll ofthe Trade Federation,
I might add.

1180
01:28:22,130 -- 01:28:26,384
This is where chancellor Valorum's strength
will disappear.

1181
01:28:27,928 -- 01:28:30,304
[ Valorum ]
The point is conceded.

1182
01:28:30,389 -- 01:28:33,307
Will you deferyour motion
to allow a commission...

1183
01:28:33,392 -- 01:28:35,935
to explore the validity ofyour accusations?

1184
01:28:36,019 -- 01:28:37,937
I will not defer.

1185
01:28:38,021 -- 01:28:41,565
I've come before you to resolve this attack
on our sovereignty now.

1186
01:28:41,650 -- 01:28:44,694
I was not elected
to watch my people suffer and die...

1187
01:28:44,778 -- 01:28:47,530
while you discuss this invasion
in a committee.

1188
01:28:49,741 -- 01:28:52,827
Ifthis body is not capable ofaction,

1189
01:28:52,911 -- 01:28:55,955
I suggest new leadership is needed.

1190
01:28:57,708 -- 01:29:00,584
I move for a vote of no confidence...

1191
01:29:00,669 -- 01:29:02,670
in chancellor Valorum's leadership.

1192
01:29:02,754 -- 01:29:06,173
[ Senators Murmuring, Shouting ]

1193
01:29:09,761 -- 01:29:14,807
Vote now! Vote now!

1194
01:29:14,933 -- 01:29:17,685
[ Chanting Continues ]
Vote now! Vote now!
Order!

1195
01:29:17,769 -- 01:29:20,688
Now they will elect a new chancellor,

1196
01:29:20,772 -- 01:29:22,690
a strong chancellor,

1197
01:29:22,774 -- 01:29:25,693
one who will not let our tragedy continue.

1198
01:29:27,362 -- 01:29:31,699
The boy will not pass the council's test, Master.
He's too old.

1199
01:29:31,783 -- 01:29:34,744
Anakin will become a Jedi, I promise you.

1200
01:29:34,828 -- 01:29:37,747
Do not defy the council, Master,
not again.

1201
01:29:37,831 -- 01:29:40,624
I shall do what I must, Obi-Wan.

1202
01:29:42,461 -- 01:29:46,255
Ifyou would just follow the code,
you would be on the council.

1203
01:29:46,339 -- 01:29:49,508
They will not
go along with you this time.

1204
01:29:49,593 -- 01:29:52,511
You still have much to learn,
myyoung apprentice.

1205
01:29:55,807 -- 01:29:57,183
A ship.

1206
01:29:58,810 -- 01:30:00,770
A cup.

1207
01:30:00,854 -- 01:30:02,688
A ship.

1208
01:30:03,774 -- 01:30:06,317
A speeder.

1209
01:30:08,278 -- 01:30:10,196
Hmm.

1210
01:30:12,824 -- 01:30:14,742
How feel you?

1211
01:30:14,826 -- 01:30:16,744
Cold, sir.

1212
01:30:17,954 -- 01:30:19,872
Afraid are you?

1213
01:30:19,956 -- 01:30:21,916
No, sir.

1214
01:30:22,000 -- 01:30:24,627
See through you we can.

1215
01:30:24,711 -- 01:30:26,629
Be mindful ofyour feelings.

1216
01:30:26,713 -- 01:30:29,507
Your thoughts dwell on your mother.

1217
01:30:31,176 -- 01:30:33,719
I miss her.
[ Yoda ]
Mmm.

1218
01:30:33,804 -- 01:30:36,305
Afraid to lose her, I think, mmm?

1219
01:30:36,389 -- 01:30:38,599
What has that got to do with anything?

1220
01:30:38,683 -- 01:30:41,018
Everything.

1221
01:30:41,102 -- 01:30:44,188
Fear is the path to the dark side.

1222
01:30:44,272 -- 01:30:47,191
Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate.

1223
01:30:47,275 -- 01:30:50,694
Hate leads to suffering.

1224
01:30:57,202 -- 01:31:00,120
I sense much fear in you.

1225
01:31:13,009 -- 01:31:16,428
Yousa tinking
yousa people ganna die?

1226
01:31:16,513 -- 01:31:18,430
I don't know.

1227
01:31:18,515 -- 01:31:21,100
Gungans get pasted too, eh?

1228
01:31:22,853 -- 01:31:25,604
I hope not.

1229
01:31:25,689 -- 01:31:28,315
Gungans no dyin' without a fight.

1230
01:31:28,400 -- 01:31:30,317
Wesa warriors.

1231
01:31:30,402 -- 01:31:33,821
Wesa got a grand army.

1232
01:31:33,905 -- 01:31:37,324
Dat's whyyou no liken us,

1233
01:31:37,409 -- 01:31:40,286
Your Highness?

1234
01:31:41,413 -- 01:31:43,581
Your Highness.

1235
01:31:43,665 -- 01:31:46,834
Senator Palpatine has been nominated
to succeed Valorum...

1236
01:31:46,918 -- 01:31:49,003
as supreme chancellor.

1237
01:31:49,087 -- 01:31:52,006
A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one.

1238
01:31:52,090 -- 01:31:56,802
Your Majesty, if I am elected,
I promise to put an end to corruption.

1239
01:31:56,887 -- 01:31:58,596
Who else has been nominated?

1240
01:31:58,680 -- 01:32:03,017
Bail Antilles ofAlderaan
and Ainlee Teem of Malastare.

1241
01:32:03,101 -- 01:32:08,063
I feel confident our situation
will create a strong sympathy vote for us.

1242
01:32:09,774 -- 01:32:11,775
I will be chancellor.

1243
01:32:11,860 -- 01:32:14,528
I fear by the time you have control
ofthe bureaucrats,

1244
01:32:14,613 -- 01:32:17,865
there'll be nothing left ofour people,
ourway of life.

1245
01:32:17,949 -- 01:32:19,867
I understand your concern, Your Majesty.

1246
01:32:19,951 -- 01:32:23,495
Unfortunately, the Federation
has possession ofour planet.

1247
01:32:25,248 -- 01:32:29,376
Senator, this is your arena.

1248
01:32:29,461 -- 01:32:31,420
I feel I must return to mine.

1249
01:32:34,007 -- 01:32:36,926
I've decided to go back to Naboo.

1250
01:32:37,010 -- 01:32:39,011
Go back?
But, Your Majesty, be realistic.

1251
01:32:39,095 -- 01:32:41,013
They'll force you to sign the treaty.

1252
01:32:41,097 -- 01:32:43,515
I will sign no treaty, Senator.

1253
01:32:43,600 -- 01:32:46,143
My fate will be no different
than that ofour people.

1254
01:32:46,227 -- 01:32:48,145
captain.
Your Highness.

1255
01:32:48,229 -- 01:32:50,147
Ready my ship.

1256
01:32:50,231 -- 01:32:53,943
Please, Your Majesty, stay here where it's safe.

1257
01:32:54,027 -- 01:32:57,237
It is clear to me now
that the Republic no longer functions.

1258
01:32:57,322 -- 01:33:01,659
I prayyou will bring
sanity and compassion back to the senate.

1259
01:33:11,836 -- 01:33:14,421
The Force is strong with him.

1260
01:33:14,506 -- 01:33:16,465
He is to be trained, then?

1261
01:33:17,884 -- 01:33:20,970
No, he will not be trained.

1262
01:33:21,054 -- 01:33:22,805
No?

1263
01:33:24,766 -- 01:33:26,850
He is too old.

1264
01:33:26,935 -- 01:33:30,771
He is the chosen one. You must see it.

1265
01:33:30,855 -- 01:33:35,526
Mmm. clouded this boy's future is.

1266
01:33:37,696 -- 01:33:39,530
I will train him, then.

1267
01:33:43,868 -- 01:33:46,704
I take Anakin as my Padawan learner.

1268
01:33:46,788 -- 01:33:49,790
An apprentice you have, Qui-Gon.

1269
01:33:49,874 -- 01:33:52,251
Impossible to take on a second.

1270
01:33:52,335 -- 01:33:54,003
The code forbids it.

1271
01:33:54,129 -- 01:33:57,548
Obi-Wan is ready.
I am ready to face the trials.

1272
01:33:57,632 -- 01:34:01,301
Our own counsel we will keep on who is ready.

1273
01:34:01,386 -- 01:34:03,303
He is headstrong,

1274
01:34:03,388 -- 01:34:06,765
and he has much to learn ofthe living Force,
but he is capable.

1275
01:34:06,850 -- 01:34:08,892
There is little more he can learn from me.

1276
01:34:11,438 -- 01:34:13,355
Young Skywalker's fate...

1277
01:34:13,440 -- 01:34:15,315
will be decided later.

1278
01:34:15,400 -- 01:34:17,985
Now is not the time for this.

1279
01:34:18,069 -- 01:34:20,738
The senate is voting for a new supreme chancellor,

1280
01:34:20,822 -- 01:34:23,532
and Queen Amidala is returning home,

1281
01:34:23,616 -- 01:34:26,869
which will put pressure on the Federation and
could widen the confrontation.

1282
01:34:26,953 -- 01:34:29,288
And draw out the queen's attacker.

1283
01:34:29,372 -- 01:34:33,792
Go with the queen to Naboo
and discover the identity ofthis dark warrior.

1284
01:34:35,045 -- 01:34:36,962
This is the clue we need...

1285
01:34:37,047 -- 01:34:39,339
to unravel the mystery ofthe Sith.

1286
01:34:39,424 -- 01:34:42,259
May the Force be with you.

1287
01:34:55,440 -- 01:34:58,358
It's not disrespect, Master. It's the truth.

1288
01:34:58,443 -- 01:35:00,360
From your point ofview.

1289
01:35:00,445 -- 01:35:03,864
The boy is dangerous.
They all sense it. Why can't you?

1290
01:35:03,948 -- 01:35:06,867
His fate is uncertain. He's not dangerous.

1291
01:35:06,951 -- 01:35:09,369
The council will decide Anakin's future.

1292
01:35:09,454 -- 01:35:12,372
That should be enough foryou. Now get on board.

1293
01:35:16,211 -- 01:35:18,128
[ Whimpers ]

1294
01:35:18,213 -- 01:35:21,799
Qui-Gon, sir,
I don't want to be a problem.

1295
01:35:21,883 -- 01:35:24,134
You won't be, Ani.

1296
01:35:24,219 -- 01:35:28,347
I'm not allowed to train you,
so I want you to watch me and be mindful.

1297
01:35:28,431 -- 01:35:31,350
Always remember:

1298
01:35:31,434 -- 01:35:34,103
Your focus determines your reality.

1299
01:35:34,187 -- 01:35:37,397
Stay close to me and you'll be safe.

1300
01:35:37,482 -- 01:35:39,316
Master, sir,

1301
01:35:39,400 -- 01:35:43,028
I heard Yoda talking about midi-chlorians.

1302
01:35:43,113 -- 01:35:46,657
I've been wondering— What are midi-chlorians?

1303
01:35:47,909 -- 01:35:50,327
Midi-chlorians are a microscopic life-form...

1304
01:35:50,411 -- 01:35:52,704
that resides within all living cells.

1305
01:35:54,124 -- 01:35:57,000
They live inside me?
Inside your cells, yes.

1306
01:35:57,127 -- 01:36:00,629
And we are symbionts with them.
Symbionts?

1307
01:36:00,713 -- 01:36:04,633
Life-forms living together for mutual advantage.

1308
01:36:04,717 -- 01:36:07,636
Without the midi-chlorians, life could not exist...

1309
01:36:07,720 -- 01:36:10,556
and we would have no knowledge ofthe Force.

1310
01:36:10,640 -- 01:36:12,558
They continually speak to us,

1311
01:36:12,642 -- 01:36:15,352
telling us the will ofthe Force.

1312
01:36:15,436 -- 01:36:17,604
When you learn to quiet your mind,

1313
01:36:17,689 -- 01:36:19,606
you'll hear them speaking to you.

1314
01:36:19,691 -- 01:36:21,608
I don't understand.

1315
01:36:21,693 -- 01:36:25,195
With time and training, Ani, you will. You will.

1316
01:36:29,033 -- 01:36:33,287
Your Majesty, it is our pleasure to continue
to serve and protect you.

1317
01:36:33,371 -- 01:36:35,289
I welcome your help.

1318
01:36:35,373 -- 01:36:38,792
Senator Palpatine fears
that the Federation means to destroy me.

1319
01:36:38,877 -- 01:36:42,087
I assure you I will not allow that to happen.

1320
01:36:42,172 -- 01:36:45,090
Wesa goin' ho-o-o-me!

1321
01:36:45,175 -- 01:36:48,093
Come on, R2.
[ Whistles ]

1322
01:36:56,644 -- 01:36:59,730
Is the planet secure?

1323
01:36:59,814 -- 01:37:03,734
We have taken over the last pockets
of primitive life-forms.

1324
01:37:03,818 -- 01:37:06,945
We are in complete control
ofthe planet now.

1325
01:37:07,030 -- 01:37:12,910
Good. I will see to it that in the senate
things stay as they are.

1326
01:37:12,994 -- 01:37:16,914
I am sending my apprentice,
Darth Maul, tojoin you.

1327
01:37:16,998 -- 01:37:18,916
Yes, my lord.

1328
01:37:19,000 -- 01:37:20,918
A Sith here?

1329
01:37:26,299 -- 01:37:28,800
Those are the forward stabilizers.

1330
01:37:28,885 -- 01:37:31,303
And those two control the pitch?

1331
01:37:32,847 -- 01:37:34,765
You catch on pretty quick.

1332
01:37:34,849 -- 01:37:36,767
[ Panaka ]
As soon as we land,

1333
01:37:36,851 -- 01:37:39,603
the Federation will arrest you
and force you to sign the treaty.

1334
01:37:39,687 -- 01:37:43,440
I agree. I'm not sure
what you wish to accomplish by this.

1335
01:37:43,524 -- 01:37:46,443
I will take back what's ours.

1336
01:37:46,527 -- 01:37:48,987
There are too few of us, Your Highness.

1337
01:37:49,072 -- 01:37:50,989
We have no army.

1338
01:37:51,074 -- 01:37:54,660
And I can only protect you.
I can't fight a war foryou.

1339
01:37:54,744 -- 01:37:56,745
JarJar Binks.

1340
01:37:56,829 -- 01:37:59,873
Mesa, Your Highness?

1341
01:37:59,958 -- 01:38:02,876
Yes. I need your help.

1342
01:38:08,091 -- 01:38:10,342
I have one battleship on my scope.

1343
01:38:10,426 -- 01:38:12,552
[ Obi-Wan ]
It's a droid control ship.

1344
01:38:12,637 -- 01:38:14,554
They've probably spotted us.

1345
01:38:14,639 -- 01:38:16,682
We haven't much time.

1346
01:38:28,152 -- 01:38:32,072
JarJar is on his way
to the Gungan city, Master.
Good.

1347
01:38:32,156 -- 01:38:35,075
Do you think
the queen's idea will work?

1348
01:38:35,159 -- 01:38:38,078
The Gungans will not be easily swayed.

1349
01:38:38,162 -- 01:38:41,039
And we cannot use our power to help her.

1350
01:38:42,792 -- 01:38:45,919
I'm— I'm sorry for my behavior, Master.

1351
01:38:46,004 -- 01:38:49,798
It's not my place
to disagree with you about the boy.

1352
01:38:51,676 -- 01:38:55,012
And I am grateful you think
I'm ready to take the trials.

1353
01:38:56,097 -- 01:38:58,015
You've been a good apprentice, Obi-Wan.

1354
01:38:59,434 -- 01:39:02,352
And you're a much wiser man than I am.

1355
01:39:02,437 -- 01:39:06,189
I foresee you will become a greatJedi knight.

1356

Desa nobody dare.

1359
01:39:21,664 -- 01:39:23,874
The Gungan city is deserted.

1360
01:39:23,958 -- 01:39:26,543
Some kinda fight, mesa tinks.

1361
01:39:26,627 -- 01:39:29,755
Do you think they have been
taken to the camps?

1362
01:39:29,839 -- 01:39:32,174
More likely they were wiped out.

1363
01:39:32,300 -- 01:39:35,385
Mesa no tink so.
Do you know where they are,JarJar?

1364
01:39:35,470 -- 01:39:38,930
When in trouble, Gungans go to sacred place.

1365
01:39:39,015 -- 01:39:41,933
Mesa showyou. come on. Mesa showyou!

1366

[ Creatures Bleating ]

1367
01:39:59,452 -- 01:40:03,914
Your Honor, Queen Amidala ofthe Naboo.

01:40:09,087 -- 01:40:13,882
Uh, h-heyo dadee,

I come before you in peace.

1373
01:40:27,063 -- 01:40:29,940

We have searched you out
because we wish to form an alliance.

1378
01:40:44,455 -- 01:40:47,374

I am Queen Amidala.
Huh?

1380
01:40:51,379 -- 01:40:53,296
This is my decoy,

1381
01:40:53,381 -- 01:40:56,758
my protection, my loyal bodyguard.

1382
01:40:56,843 -- 01:41:01,179
I'm sorry for my deception,
but it was necessary to protect myself.

1383
01:41:01,264 -- 01:41:04,182
Although we do not always agree, Your Honor,

1384
01:41:04,267 -- 01:41:07,185
our two great societies
have always lived in peace.

1385
01:41:07,270 -- 01:41:09,187
- Ah.
- The Trade Federation...

1386
01:41:09,272 -- 01:41:11,481
has destroyed all
that we have worked so hard to build.

1387
01:41:11,566 -- 01:41:14,901
Ifwe do not act quickly,
all will be lost forever.

1388
01:41:14,986 -- 01:41:17,237
I askyou to help us.

1389
01:41:17,321 -- 01:41:20,073
No, I beg you to help us.

1390
01:41:20,158 -- 01:41:22,534
We are your humble servants.

1391
01:41:24,996 -- 01:41:28,582
Our fate is in your hands.

1392
01:41:28,666 -- 01:41:31,168

Yippee! Ya-hoo!

1405
01:42:11,209 -- 01:42:13,543
We've sent our patrols.

1406
01:42:13,628 -- 01:42:17,130
We already located
their starship in the swamp.

1407
01:42:17,215 -- 01:42:19,424
It won't be long, my lord.

1408
01:42:19,509 -- 01:42:22,677
This is an unexpected move for her.

1409
01:42:22,762 -- 01:42:24,804
It's too aggressive.

1410
01:42:24,889 -- 01:42:27,349
Lord Maul, be mindful.

1411
01:42:27,433 -- 01:42:30,018
Let them make the first move.

1412
01:42:30,102 -- 01:42:32,062
Yes, my master.

1413

They're here!

1416
01:42:43,574 -- 01:42:45,534

and da Naboo together.

01:43:07,765 -- 01:43:09,766
[ Qui-Gon ]
Captain.
[ Laughing ]

1425
01:43:09,850 -- 01:43:12,519
Your Highness.
What is the situation?

1426
01:43:12,603 -- 01:43:14,521
Almost everyone's in camps.

1427
01:43:14,605 -- 01:43:17,857
A few hundred police and guards
have formed an underground resistance movement.

1428
01:43:17,942 -- 01:43:20,527
I brought back
as many ofthe leaders as I could.

1429
01:43:20,611 -- 01:43:25,282
The Federation army's also
much larger than we thought, and much stronger.

1430
01:43:25,366 -- 01:43:29,703
Your Highness, this is a battle
I do not think that we can win.

1431
01:43:29,787 -- 01:43:31,705
The battle is a diversion.

1432
01:43:31,789 -- 01:43:35,000
The Gungans must draw the droid army
away from the cities.

1433

R2.
[ Beeps ]

1434
01:43:37,753 -- 01:43:41,381
We can enter the city using the secret passages
on the waterfall side.

1435
01:43:41,465 -- 01:43:43,383
Once we get to the main entrance,

1436
01:43:43,467 -- 01:43:46,303
Captain Panaka will create a diversion.

1437
01:43:46,387 -- 01:43:49,347
Then we can enter the palace
and capture the viceroy.

1438
01:43:49,432 -- 01:43:52,726
Without the viceroy,
they will be lost and confused.

1439
01:43:52,810 -- 01:43:54,728
What do you think, MasterJedi?

1440
01:43:54,812 -- 01:43:56,980
The viceroy will be well-guarded.

1441
01:43:57,064 -- 01:43:59,482
The difficulty is getting into the throne room.

1442
01:43:59,567 -- 01:44:02,027
Once we're inside,
we shouldn't have a problem.

1443
01:44:02,111 -- 01:44:06,865
There is a possibility, with this diversion,
many Gungans will be killed.

1444
01:44:06,949 -- 01:44:10,285
Wesa ready to do our-san part.

1445
01:44:10,369 -- 01:44:13,580
[ Amidala ] We have a plan which should
immobilize the droid army.

1446
01:44:13,664 -- 01:44:15,582
We will send what pilots we have...

1447
01:44:15,666 -- 01:44:18,710
to knock out the droid control ship
orbiting the planet.

1448
01:44:18,794 -- 01:44:21,921
A well-conceived plan.
However, there's great risk.

1449
01:44:22,006 -- 01:44:24,924
The weapons on your fighters
may not penetrate the shields.

1450
01:44:25,009 -- 01:44:26,926
[ Obi-Wan ]
There's an even bigger danger.

1451
01:44:27,011 -- 01:44:28,928
Ifthe viceroy escapes, Your Highness,

1452
01:44:29,013 -- 01:44:31,264
he will return with another droid army.

1453
01:44:31,349 -- 01:44:34,601
Well, that is why we must not
fail to get the viceroy.

1454
01:44:34,685 -- 01:44:36,603
Everything depends on it.

1455
01:44:38,689 -- 01:44:40,607
[ Beeps, Whistles ]

1456
01:44:42,026 -- 01:44:44,611
She is more foolish than I thought.

1457
01:44:44,695 -- 01:44:49,658
We are sending all troops to meet this army
assembling near the swamp.

1458
01:44:49,742 -- 01:44:52,452
It appears to be made up of primitives.

1459
01:44:52,536 -- 01:44:55,121
This will work to our advantage.

1460
01:44:55,206 -- 01:44:57,999
I have your approval to proceed, then, my lord?

1461
01:44:58,084 -- 01:45:00,543
Wipe them out.

1462
01:45:02,213 -- 01:45:04,172
All ofthem.

1464
01:45:34,954 -- 01:45:36,913

Open fire.

1469
01:46:28,257 -- 01:46:32,177
Once we get inside,
you find a safe place to hide and stay there.

1470
01:46:32,303 -- 01:46:34,220
Sure.
Stay there.

1471
01:46:38,809 -- 01:46:40,477

Roger. Roger.

1473
01:47:00,247 -- 01:47:03,374
I thought the battle
